        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="What-are-video-games"><a href="#What-are-video-games" class="headerlink" title="What are video games?"></a>What are video games?</h1><p>Video games are a very broad concept. Because it is well known that video games are a type of games. Then video games should bring many different ways of relaxation just like games. “But is that the case?” Many people ask such questions. Obviously I’m not one of them. Because I personally don’t think video games are electronic heroin. The reason for this is as follows.</p><h2 id="First-point"><a href="#First-point" class="headerlink" title="First point"></a>First point</h2><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/1p/wallhaven-1pj25v.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://wallhaven.cc/w/1pj25v">https://wallhaven.cc/w/1pj25v</a></p><p>What do you see? Huge whale? prosperous city? The world of science fiction? Obviously we all know this is not the real world that exists. But that’s why it’s attractive, and the degree to which it appeals to different people is different. For example, working adults and teenagers. Adults often don’t have more energy to fantasize due to work and family reasons, so they are less attractive to the world of science fiction. But teenagers look forward to such a world more, and they will imagine that if they live in such a world, this is one of the main reasons why they can be attracted. Let’s talk about video games again. The picture of video games is the same as the picture above. My personal opinion is that it’s quite normal to be attracted by this kind of sci-fi world. If even such a world can’t bring considerable attraction to human beings, then there should be a lot of problems with human emotions.</p><h2 id="Second-point"><a href="#Second-point" class="headerlink" title="Second point"></a>Second point</h2><h3 id="Analyze-the-issue-from-the-perspective-of-beauty"><a href="#Analyze-the-issue-from-the-perspective-of-beauty" class="headerlink" title="Analyze the issue from the perspective of beauty."></a>Analyze the issue from the perspective of beauty.</h3><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png" alt="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png"></p><p>Cite:<a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png</a></p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg" alt="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg</a>: </p><p>The two pictures above are quite stunning. One is from reality and the other is from fantasy. I believe both images will appeal to us.</p><h4 id="Let-me-tell-a-story"><a href="#Let-me-tell-a-story" class="headerlink" title="Let me tell a story."></a>Let me tell a story.</h4><p>You are a knight from the west, you train hard every day, you made your body is very strong, and you have a very good blacksmith friend, he made you an armor that is very suitable for you. You are very happy. But not long after, the war came, a bloody battle, oneself person with a sword, killed seven times in and seven times out in the royal city. The enemy is thrown off his feet by the one you kill. But in the end, due to lack of strength and preparation, you were defeated in the end. You also fell in a pool of blood. When you open your eyes again, what you see is the roof of a small wooden house, and a beautiful girl is wiping your cheek, and she is overjoyed to see you open your eyes. But you can’t hear her voice at all at this time, you can only see her mouth moving. You try to open your mouth but feel severe pain. In desperation, you try to show her with your hand that you can’t hear her, but when you try to make this gesture. You find that you can’t feel your arms and hands anymore. You start to panic, you feel a huge sense of oppression, you don’t know what’s going on, the hand that was so obedient before has no feeling at all at this moment. You blink desperately and call for her help. She seems to understand what you mean, her hands hover over your face, and you see her cherry lips slightly open and close. You notice a faint green glow in the palm of her hand resting on your face. You don’t understand, and you dare not move. After a few minutes, your ears began to hear the slightest sound, and some words that you could not understand came from the mouth of the girl in front of you. You tried to open your mouth to ask, but she looked at you and shook her head slightly, signaling you to wait a little longer. After a few more minutes, the girl stopped whispering and said to you, you can talk now. You try to open your mouth again, this time without the slightest pain. You ask where this is. The girl didn’t answer your question, but said, “Your arm is still hurt. I have applied herbs and used healing magic on you. It should heal in a few days.” After the girl’s conversation You know that this is a place with Ling (Spirit power) and magic. According to the girl, this is a country that exists in the east of the world…</p><p>Now it’s a story I wrote casually. I’m still thinking about the follow-up of the story, but this is the text I thought about through the two pictures above. If I use it for a video game, I don’t know if anyone will like it, but this is it I want to explain. The appeal of video games is through fantasy, and human fantasy is very great. So it is very normal for people to be attracted to video games.</p>]]></content>

As shown in the picture above, very cute? I hope I’m using the right words. It also shows that there are many kinds of video games. But often people like extreme cases, because then they can find the point of attack. But it is always ordinary players and some parents who are injured. Back to the original god. The character of the original god can control one of the seven natural elements ice, grass, fire, water, wind, thunder, and rock. These elements can interact in different ways, and switching characters during combat and performing these abilities allows these elements to interact. Solving puzzles in the overworld may require certain elemental abilities. The game uses an open world map. In addition to normal walking, players can explore various ruins and terrains by climbing, swimming, gliding and other mobile means.</p><p>Compared with games with violent elements such as GTA V, Genshine Impact is very peaceful.</p><p>This is a simple example to refute the case that video games simply bring violence.</p>]]></content>

These games are played on consoles, PCs and mobile phones. Games can be competitive or non-competitive. Most games are action-oriented and require physical exertion from the player. Games have become so advanced that they can simulate real-life situations. However, some people become addicted to gaming and find themselves unable to stop playing. There are many aspects to taking away someone’s ability to enjoy a game, but understanding the problem is a good place to start.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/d6/wallhaven-d65ymo.png"></p><p>The main reason people become video game addicts is the way these games affect the player’s thoughts and feelings. Most games these days involve violence, gambling, sex and other forms of addictive behavior. Players feel compelled to keep playing after finishing a game because they still crave more entertainment or content. Many online games have monthly or annual fees that players must pay to continue playing. These types of practices have taken over the gaming industry and must stop before further harm can be done.</p><p>Games today are very addictive due to the high demand for games from players. The game requires players to pay attention to their physical needs; they eat while they play and sleep at night. Players can also spend money on games and get game codes via PayPal or other payment methods. All this physical exertion leaves the players exhausted, but unable to stop the game. Games also provide a sense of accomplishment that non-games cannot. When players complete a challenging game, they feel a sense of worth; this is similar to how drugs or alcohol feel in a user’s system.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/rr/wallhaven-rr7l31.jpg"></p><h2 id="But"><a href="#But" class="headerlink" title="But"></a>But</h2><p>Video games has become a part of our daily lives; They are also an integral part of our leisure activities.

Mobile games or video games</h4><p>​There are currently more than 2.5 billion video game players worldwide, and the market is expected to exceed $90 billion by 2020. In order to stand out in this huge market, companies must understand what types of games women are most passionate about and why. A study by data analytics firm Newzoo found that women are generally more likely than men to play games for stress relief or entertainment purposes. The mobile gaming market now accounts for more than 50% of the global gaming market and is expected to grow by double digits. Of those, 64 percent of women prefer to play games on mobile devices, compared to 38 percent of men. Meanwhile, 43 percent of female mobile gamers reported playing games five or more days a week. These numbers are indirect evidence of the purchasing power of female gamers.</p><p><img src="https://www.eastwestbank.com/content/dam/ewb-dotcom/reachfurther/newsarticlestore/586/Women-in-video-gaming-top4.jpg"></p><p>Cite（<a href="https://www.eastwestbank.com/content/dam/ewb-dotcom/reachfurther/newsarticlestore/586/Women-in-video-gaming-top4.jpg%EF%BC%89">https://www.eastwestbank.com/content/dam/ewb-dotcom/reachfurther/newsarticlestore/586/Women-in-video-gaming-top4.jpg）</a></p><h4 id="Why-don’t-female-get-good-looks-in-video-games"><a href="#Why-don’t-female-get-good-looks-in-video-games" class="headerlink" title="Why don’t female get good looks in video games"></a>Why don’t female get good looks in video games</h4><p>​In the world, the number of female gamers is gradually increasing, but there is no denying that the number of female gamers will not surpass that of male gamers in the short term. The reason is that there are too few games for girls. </p><p>​Girls love to play games, but love is not so deep. We want to see more girls enjoy games. A lot of girls like video games not because they like video games, but because they like video games for other reasons, like because a friend likes video games, so when they try to play video games.

Not just because it’s a video game question, but because it encompasses countless family relationship questions. Video games are not monsters, much less electronic drugs. Video games began in the United States in the late 1960s. They first started to develop on arcade machines or video game consoles (home consoles, handheld consoles), and then games on personal computers and mobile device platforms appeared. Electronic games mainly consist of games inherited from traditional gaming activities: electronic games such as football, baseball, chess, word and number games. It also has functions that traditional games do not have, such as adventures, wars, and events from human fantasy worlds. Although video games have been criticized for their potentially harmful effects, researchers have found ways to use them to help people live better.</p><p>​Video games are very attractive. This feature can not only make people addicted, but also can become a “vivid textbook” with proper conversion. Through the magic of video games, children can eat more vegetables, help the elderly keep their brains active, and even use video games to solve social problems such as poverty and climate change.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/o5/wallhaven-o5d1zm.jpg"></p><p>Cite：<a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/o5/wallhaven-o5d1zm.jpg">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/o5/wallhaven-o5d1zm.jpg</a></p><p>As shown in the picture above, there may be such a huge sci-fi space station in the future world.

You can play casually, or join competitions with other players in the area, which can be fun and rewarding. So games are one of the ways to relax.</p><p>​Games can help people connect with others in a meaningful way. One of the advantages of playing games is that it creates a sense of community among players across the globe who interact with each other and become friends through online games. This allows people to socialize and form new friendships without leaving the house, and can also help those with poor social skills.</p><hr><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/9d/wallhaven-9d5o8w.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://wallhaven.cc/w/9d5o8w">https://wallhaven.cc/w/9d5o8w</a></p><h4 id="Opposition"><a href="#Opposition" class="headerlink" title="Opposition"></a>Opposition</h4><p>Those concerned about the harm video games can cause might point to games in the <em><a href="https://go-gale-com.ezp.slu.edu/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&u=sain44199&id=GALE%7CEJ3010669101&v=2.1&it=r&asid=46c19cba.#">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series or the <em>Halo</em> series.

But at the same time, I hope that those who claim that video games cause or induce people to crime and violence will understand more about the core of a video game. Every good video game is the product of a group of dozens, or even hundreds of people, that took years to complete. Each of their works is created around a theme. It’s like a play, there are good guys on the team, and there are bad guys on the team. The creation concept of this play cannot be denied just because of the appearance of villains. And the most important thing is that whether a person is good or bad is not determined by a video game. Their family, teachers, parents, and friends will guide them to understand what is right. That’s why I disagree with the objections, they’re just describing a scene from a video game in a one-sided way, like a paragraph in a novel. This is not enough to prove that video games cause violence and harm society.</p><p>Work Cites (MLA)</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>“History of video games”. advance-lexis-com.ezp.slu.edu&#x2F;api&#x2F;document?      collection&#x3D;news&amp;id&#x3D;urn:contentItem:666D-HBR1-JCG7-8567-00000-00&amp;context&#x3D;1516831. </p><p>“Can video games be addictive?

The earliest recorded video game was a Tic-Tac-Toe game played on a vacuum tube computer in 1952. Video games were introduced as a commercial entertainment medium in the 1970s and became the basis of a significant entertainment industry in Japan, the United States and Europe in the late 1970s.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/we/wallhaven-we87vx.jpg"></p><h4 id="Video-Gameplay-Effects"><a href="#Video-Gameplay-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Video Gameplay Effects"></a>Video Gameplay Effects</h4><p>​Video games mentioned by the author are one of the computer-based ways to play games, and video games can also be effective in relieving physical and mental addictions. The problem here I think is the difference between the definition of video game addiction and the definition of other types of addiction. At the same time, the author puts forward a very effective point Author Ford talked about the physical exercise that video games can bring, such as physical activity. There are also video games that improve the hands-on skills of children and people. This boosts your child’s self-confidence in many ways. And video games mean the cutting-edge level of technology. As one of the most powerful products in the software era, video games must be very influential. And in the game, people can get a lot of activities that cannot be done in real life. Such as jungle adventures, horror survival games, zombies, shooting games, many people like guns, but in reality guns are more dangerous, so they can understand the structure of guns, the range of bullets, and the difference between different guns in the game. the difference. And from a psychological level, video games have certain competitiveness, which can also exercise people’s fear of competition, so that people who play video games can better understand social interaction and how to communicate with people. And in some cases, players can get jobs through games and earn money through games.Even if video games can help people’s brains stay active, it can prevent the occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>​Video games emerged as a form of relaxation and entertainment. Subsequently, with the development of computer technology, it gradually evolved into an effective tool. In addition to being a form of leisure entertainment, video games can also be used as a means of education and medical treatment.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/3l/wallhaven-3l9z69.png"></p><hr><p>Work Cites</p><p>“Why Should You Play Video Games?”. advance-lexis-com.ezp.slu.edu&#x2F;api&#x2F;document?collection&#x3D;news&amp;id&#x3D;urn:contentItem:664J-N511-F03R-N0Y5-00000-00&amp;context&#x3D;1516831.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Scholar-Officials</p><p><em>Su Li</em></p><p><em>Only the benevolent ought to be in high stations</em>.</p><p>—MENCIUS<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_1">1</a></p><p><em>Until philosophers are kings of the city-state, or the so-called kings and princes of [this] the present world truly and fervently love [have the spirit and power of] philosophy, and political power [greatness] and wisdom blend into [meet in] one like water and milk</em>, … <em>cities will never have rest from their evils</em> … <em>and then only will this our [State] constitution have a real possibility of life and behold the light of day</em>.</p><p>—PLATO<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_2">2</a></p><p><em>Defining the Problem</em></p><p>I have already analyzed and discussed how the two most important cultural constitutional institutions of ancient China—a unified script and Mandarin Chinese—called forth, shaped, and constructed scholars from the countless village communities of historical China and turned them into a class of scholars (the scholar-officials) who belonged not only to their local villages and clans but also to China’s political and cultural tradition, and thus can be said to be different from ordinary people. The cultural education and knowledge of the scholars from the whole country led them to form a statewide cultural community while still preserving sufficient local origins and roots. It was also a cultural community that traversed history, since it bound together scholars of the past, present, and future. They originally came from local areas, even from some nowheres that had been overlooked by people of this world, yet because of their literacy, because they read books, because of their refined speech or Mandarin Chinese, and the ideals and pursuits of their political and cultural life, at the same time as they attained this sense of belonging to the entire world under heaven, they also belonged to the territory, politics, and culture of this China, both ancient and ever new. Indeed, it might be that they fell into such poverty that they could only save their own skin, but their thoughts and feelings would never fall away from the goal they had once embraced.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_3">3</a></p><p>However, for their lives to be truly part of the living structure of ancient China, for them to move from a conscious sense of belonging to China on the cultural level to becoming absorbed in China and building up China on the level of daily practice, constructing China by drawing together east and west, north and south, even high and low, an institution was necessary—which may seem to be cultural but was in fact mainly political. This institution would select them in a reasonable, equitable, and fairly accurate manner and allow them to participate in the various levels of administration in the state, and in this way it took them from a social level and transform them into a political and cultural elite that would function on the level of the body politic. This chapter focuses on this basic political or constitutional institution of their cultural, but also political, selection.</p><p>But is this a constitutional issue? Is it not only a matter of civil service exams? Administrative law or constitutional law should be enough then. Moreover, what society is there that is not governed by an elite? To tell the truth, without mincing words, what society is there in which “those who work with the mind rule over others and those who labour are ruled over by others”?<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_4">4</a> For the moment we will not discuss whether the yardstick for judging the elite is subjective or objective, whether it looks to individual talent or is influenced by relatives and acquaintances, or is due to the educational training a particular person has received, or even if it is selection by throwing dice, as in the ancient Athenian democracy, since history records that clearly the elite still had influence. We have heard, or know, about the names of Draco, Solon, Peisistratos, Cleisthenes, and Pericles and not “the great Greek people” or “the people of Athens.” Does the addition of a high-sounding epithet such as universal values, justice, constitution, or truth raise someone up to be much closer to God, striding alone through the night and obviating the need to blow a whistle?</p><p>Therefore, this chapter must show why the way in which ancient China chose its political and cultural elite was different from, for example, ancient Greek society, such that it needed a special institutional framework even if this was subject to constant evolution. Moreover, why is that we can say that there was a form of constitutional institution founded in ancient China that had to do with a political elite, and what is the evidence for this way of speaking?</p><p>The basic premise, constraint, and condition is that ancient China was already a large state composed both of countless rural communities whose people never interacted with one another and of many different cultural groups. China was not like other ancient states that were small in comparison, such as the citystates of ancient Greece and Rome—and also including the later monarchical states or city-states of Europe such as Florence and Geneva—which naturally formed a political, economic, and social unit, nor like the larger monarchical states of medieval Europe in which a royal house shared rule with aristocrats of varying degrees, still less like the nation-states of today with their close political and economic links between places and their developed networks for transportation and communications. What makes historical China unique and explains why ancient China’s elite political class was very different in practice from the elite politicians of ancient city-states in the West or modern Western nationstates is, first, a series of questions: Given the social conditions of ancient China, would it be possible to adopt a meritocracy among politicians? In what sense would this be a meritocracy? What standard should be used to measure the elite? Was the standard accurate? In many small-scale societies and small states, it would not seem too difficult to resolve these questions, but in the context of ancient China, they become huge issues that are beyond the power of the imagination to solve. To say that these questions were “big” implies that they were not simply invented; they were of the nature of basic presuppositions. For instance, a question may be described as belonging to historical <em>China</em> or to a local area. Even such a small issue requires a statewide consensus, based on the people’s universal acceptance of and acquiescence in it.</p><p>China is a large country, and hence, whatever way of choosing and promoting officials is chosen in the context of the whole elite political institution the highest layer of politics must always keep many political considerations in mind and arrange for detailed and appropriate institutions, including the comprehensive restraints of a peaceful balance for political participation, by representatives of the interests of each place, national group, and nation. As society changed and in accordance with the special nature of some of the dynasties, such as the Yuan and Qing, in which minority peoples from the borders ruled the central plain, these considerations would show at the institutional level.</p><p>Also, since it was a large state, in historical China no planned design for an ideal institution for the selection of an elite could be simultaneously set up, and even if it were, it could never be used universally in all parts of the country. Hence, the institution for selecting the elite had to be ongoing, like a glacier that slowly but surely leaves a deep and implacable impression on even the hardest rock.</p><p>This is all something that civil service exams do not cover, nor is it something that the imperial exams discussed in this chapter necessarily covered. We must, and can only, take a constitutional view to review and understand the great constitutional significance of the institutional arrangements for ancient China.</p><p>This chapter addresses five questions:</p><p>First, how was the social consensus for historical China’s meritocracy formed, and what are its foundations? Given that early China, at least the Western Zhou, laid a great emphasis on family relationships, and later Confucians continued to value these relations of consanguinity, how is it that in the sphere of China’s ancient politics and constitution, family relationships were subordinate to the demand for the efficiency and efficacy of a rational political administration, such that the consideration of a meritocracy may be said to run through China’s ancient constitution from beginning to end.</p><p>Second, there is the problem of the creation of ancient China’s meritocracy, which is not the tale of Bo Le and the thousand-league horse, as many famous people have mistakenly believed and said.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_5">5</a> Rather—and it has always been so—in a large state, how can you select an elite in an institutional way that is fair, accurate, and effective? Hence, it is a question of institutions and not of personal knowledge or moral standing.</p><p>Third, given the social importance of the political elite for historical China, any sites of influence or any levels of power in society would strive by all means possible, both formal and informal, to exert their political influence, and therefore, in establishing a statewide, uniform, standardized institution for selection, the central government represented by the monarchy would certainly have conflicts of interest of all kinds with other powers in society. The evolution and development of the means of selection in ancient China from selections (推举, <em>tuiju</em>) to recommendations (察举, <em>chaju</em>) and to examinations (科举, <em>keju</em>) reflect the historical nature of the institution and its adaptation to the political, economic, social, and cultural conditions of each historical era.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_6">6</a> They also reflect an inherent logic of political rationalization.</p><p>Fourth, for the standardization and comparative accuracy of the selection, historical China had no choice but to rely on a standardized written exam for the statewide selection of the elite. The ability measured by this method was not the practical rationality that was required for ancient China’s political governance. Hence, alongside the institutions of the selections, recommendations, and examinations, there had to be other methods of testing, verifying, and allowing for practical assessment to reinforce the exams themselves. This must not be overlooked.</p><p>Fifth, given that China was a large country, with a complicated and vast natural terrain and many different nationalities and cultures, and for some issues had a pluralism of interests, the institution of selection had to also take into account factors of mobility between places and in society. Unlike the representative institutions that emerged in the post-medieval West and developed in modern times, the selection of the elite in ancient China to a certain extent was indeed a form of institutional engagement in society and politics and one that even brought an element of representation.</p><p>It is sufficient to raise all these questions to realize that ancient China’s selection of a political elite and their participation in government can unashamedly be called “constitutional.” It may be, or must be, those Chinese constitutional scholars who nowadays <em>only talk</em> about <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> or <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> who feel ashamed before the great constitution of ancient China. “Great” here does not mean politically correct, but that, whether you agree or disagree with it, it transcends the issue of good or bad.</p><p><em>Meritocracy as Constitutional Consensus</em></p><p>The constitution of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou is said to be based on hereditary law. Yet the precise institutions of the Xia and Shang are not clear. Those of the Western Zhou are somewhat clearer and serve as a model. In principle the Western Zhou was a time when the Son of Heaven apportioned the world under heaven to princes of the royal blood. The Son of Heaven, feudal lords, ministers, and scholars had duties according to their place in the hierarchy and administered the state by hereditary succession: “hereditary succession and inherited incomes.” In light of this, elsewhere I have discussed how reliance on family relationships arose from a rational, political, and constitutional consideration, in that it was an instrumental use of consanguinity and not simply a politics that sought consanguinity as its foundation, nor was it a matter of subordinating political rank to consanguinity or affinity. As soon as it was necessary and feasible politically, family relationships necessarily ceded place. Thus, in the Shang and Zhou, the daily political running of the state increasingly valued the talent of the rulers. After King Wuding of the Shang ascended the throne, he named a slave, who was clearly of a foreign race but was an outstanding politician, as prime minister.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_7">7</a> King Zhou of the Shang “did not use the younger brothers of the king’s father and mother.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_8">8</a> Instead he employed criminals who had fled from all over the place.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_9">9</a> The Western Zhou, which would seem to have set more store by blood relations, also tended toward a meritocracy. Guan Shu and Cai Shu were uncles of King Cheng, but the younger and worthier Duke of Zhou was appointed to assist in ruling. Jiang Ziya and other foreign members of the political elite also entered the ranks of the ruling class, participated, and shared in political governance.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_10">10</a></p><p>This shows that, whether or not one says one upholds some principle or however one labels oneself, the iron rule of politics is that, provided the final policy or decision maker has a sufficient number of options, competition within the ruling body or from outside the country will force the shape of the practical governance of a state to move in the direction of meritocracy. If not, then either this ruling clique or the political community it rules over will be made obsolete.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_11">11</a></p><p>Therefore, by the time of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, fierce competition among the feudal states had already destroyed the ritual and administrative sensibility of the Western Zhou. Things went from “rites, music, expeditions, and punishments proceed from the Son of Heaven” to “they proceed from the feudal princes,” to “from the prime minister,” to “the accompanying ministers lay hold of the destiny of the state.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_12">12</a> These events show clearly that only if hereditary succession was transformed into rule by persons who had the capacity to acquire, hold on to, and manage power could it be retained. As a result of some genetic factors, home education, possession of books, and the opportunity to take part earlier in high political posts (what may be termed the earliest form of a second generation of officials), in the Warring States and even in the Qin-Han period there were many generations of elite persons. In addition to the four great sons of dukes of the Warring States period, the most outstanding were several military families. For instance, in the state of Zhao there was Zhao She and his son Zhao Kuo; in Qin there was Wang Jian and his son Wang Fen and the family of Meng Ao, Meng Wu, Meng Tian, and Meng Yi. In Chu there was the Xiang family. From the Warring States period to the Han there was the Li family: Li Xin, Li Guang, Li Gan, and Li Ling, and in the Han dynasty there was Zhou Bo and his son Zhou Yafu. But overall, the days of hereditary ministers and salaries were beginning to pass. “The aura of a gentleman lasts five generations and then is snuffed out” had already become general social practice.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_13">13</a> It was talent that was to become the norm of the future. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, a number of talented politicians had already sprung up, such as Guan Zhong, Bai Lixi, and Lan Xiangru.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_14">14</a></p><p>The norm of “valuing the worthy” in the sense of paying respect to an individual’s ability may be said to have already become the political consensus of the society. But what is a worthy? What abilities were required to constitute a person as one of the elite? What terms, what language, would allow the higher level of politicians in the various states to understand and accept some standard of worth in an effective way? In differentiating between the talents of different individuals, what should be the norm and what would its social consequences be?</p><p>The worth that Confucius valued included a knowledge of books, practice of the rites, benevolence, wisdom and courage, filial piety, and fraternal love. It would seem that the stress here is on individual virtue. Yet through the generations, what Confucians valued was that which would enable a state to “have sufficient food and a sufficient army,” and the political ability to “win the trust of the people.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_15">15</a> They were not interested in individual virtues in the abstract. Hence, Confucius criticized Guan Zhong for “not knowing the rites” while praising him for his efforts on behalf of all of China and Chinese civilization.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_16">16</a> The “worth and ability” esteemed by the Legalists were even more concrete, including rewards for farming, enriching the state, and strengthening the army, such that one could attack towns and seize land.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_17">17</a></p><p>This is not something that arose spontaneously out of Confucian or Legalist ideas. Rather, in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, fierce political and military competition among the states led to them actively seeking, discovering, and appointing talented people to take part in the governance of their states and thus increasing their chances in the competition with other feudal states and political forces. Utilitarianism and pragmatism thus arose, and it is probably at that time that the saying “do not ask where a hero was born” emerged.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_18">18</a> Furthermore, social class, experience, professional category, and even flaws in personality were not so important, because “the purest water would be without fish, the perfect person without followers.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_19">19</a> Moreover, it was not only a concern for these abilities writ large. It was enough to be useful. “A rooster that crows and a dog that barks at a thief” aptly describes the kind of talent that at particular times entered into the scope of politicians in power and won favor.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_20">20</a></p><p>Political competition not only gave rise to a social consensus about meritocracy but also undid the sense of local belonging of the elite. Given the lure of interests, including political interests, and adding on the advantages of a relatively advanced system of communication in the central plain since the inception of the Western Zhou, the level of local loyalty among the political elite of the states had never been very high. Hence it was said, “The talent of Chu [the south] is used in Jin [the north].”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_21">21</a> Confucius himself did not wait every day under the tree, in the hope that a hare would kill itself by crashing into a tree trunk.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_22">22</a> Nor was he unwavering in his support for his home prefecture of Lu. Rather, he made himself into a commodity, put on the open market at the price of “if anyone uses me, can I not make an Eastern Zhou?”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_23">23</a> By the time of the Warring States, this had become the general norm. The feudal lords openly competed to recruit people of elite ability. Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Sun Wu, Sun Bin, Pang Juan, Yue Yi, Wu Qi, Wu Zi Xu, Li Kui, Shang Yang, Lü Buwei, Li Si, Han Fei, and other elite persons went around the states looking for work. Among these famous elite persons, the one exception would seem to be Qu Yuan. Many people were thereby enabled to achieve something tangible, even something great, classic examples being Shang Yang and Li Si.</p><p>What all this implies is that, excluding other considerations, the state and world under heaven formed by the feudal states of the time rejected hereditary posts and salaries at all levels and accepted a meritocracy. All sought results, in either the long or the short term. This had already become the fairly fixed consensus of society. It was just that the world under heaven was not yet firmly defined and there were insufficient practical consequences to lead people to affirm what was useful, especially to determine what talents were required for the long-term governance of the state, what people could pass the test of history as a political and cultural elite that belonged to the whole of society.</p><p>Abstract elite governance was always the ideal form of governance in China, and something that had been achieved in political practice throughout Chinese history, though China at that time had not yet a united <em>norm</em> of recognition for being elite and even later it had difficulty in keeping a norm that was valid everywhere. Not only have empiricism and dogmatism been at war over this issue since time immemorial, but at any given period of history, apart from any formally systematized channels of communication, some varying ways of communication would remain, and people would accept these changes; as Gong Zizhen said, “don’t get stuck on one way of evaluating talent.” The basic principle is that you do not ask where a hero was born, or the very pragmatic and consequentialist saying, “the one who succeeds is a king; the one who fails a rebel.” Although the second saying may seem a bit rough, it does accurately portray the ideal of the elite of secularism and populism. People do not believe in class, status, bloodlines, race, or distinctions in degrees of intelligence—though of course this does not imply that they do not take into consideration the political reliability that may accompany these traits. As a complement to the formal system, Chinese society has always had a certain tradition of anti-intellectualism.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_24">24</a> In short, what mattered was practical use and not dogmatism or the influence of heredity. I will return to this issue in the fifth section of this chapter.</p><p>Indeed, even when the minority peoples of the frontiers entered into the central plain, they kept to a meritocracy, though with many limitations on the political participation of Han Chinese scholars, especially during the Yuan dynasty. But these forms of discrimination or restriction were even clearer in the assessment of political reliability, and so were not a matter of racism. Although China did experience a time in the past when powerful clans held political influence, it had never moved in the direction of classical aristocratic rule, or toward the type of caste system found in India, or even the widespread and grave implementation of racial segregation that lasted for several centuries in the southern United States up until the mid-twentieth century.</p><p>This form of social consensus was shaped by a whole series of concrete social and national responsibilities regarding personality, education, and the political elite. These included the idea that all people shared in many basic natural talents and potentialities, though to different degrees, and so individual preferences differed. These differences might emerge as society put them into practice: “people are alike in nature, but different in customs.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_25">25</a> Genetic inheritance, home upbringing, social experience, and chance could all influence, and determine, the talents and achievements of people: “life and death are fixed; riches and standing are allotted by heaven.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_26">26</a> Yet nobody was ever determined at birth. Theoretically, thanks to one’s training at home and in society, everybody could become an important person. Important posts in society, including that of emperor, tended to be, and in fact were, open to all equally: “Are there really people such as kings, lords, generals and ministers born so?” “Anyone could seize their position and replace them.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_27">27</a> A person’s individual talent is that person’s, but it also belongs to society. A person of lesser fortune could become an important human resource of exceptional value at the disposition of society: “one who has studied should try to be an official” (<em>Analects</em>); “only the benevolent are apt for high status” (<em>Mencius</em>); “when poor one can make oneself good; when in a high position one can make the whole world good” (<em>Mencius</em>); “train yourself (修身), regulate your family (齐家), govern the state (治国), and bring peace to the world under heaven (平天下)” (<em>Great Learning</em>).<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_28">28</a> As a result, once one had become a member of the political elite, one’s political duties to the state and society superseded moral obligations to the family and family clan: “let the prince be a prince, the minister a minister, the father a father, and the son a son” (<em>Analects</em>); “loyalty to the state and filial piety do not go together” (Yan Zhenqing); “in the first place let the concerns of the world be your concerns; secondly, let the joys of the world be your joys” (Fan Zhongyan); “even in a low position they did not dare to forget their concern for the state” (Lu You).<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_29">29</a> Education is the main conduit by which society and people themselves could develop and use these human resources effectively: “unless you study the rites, you do not have a foot to stand on.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_30">30</a> The core of education is training received in the family, as can be seen in the stories <em>The Three Refusals of Mencius’ Mother</em> and “to fail to educate one’s son is a fault of the father.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_31">31</a></p><p>Given these basic presuppositions about natural talent, development of ability, and their significance for society, over the course of history, China was faced with various political considerations that always came together in the promotion of the worthy or in participation in political governance by a political and cultural elite. Viewed as a political ideal and seen as a social practice, it was always in contrast to the emperor, who treated the world as his family. Dynasties throughout history encouraged and recruited—which is a kind of forced request—the scholars of the empire to take part in government and stressed that the political elite should assume responsibility: “the responsibility is heavy and the road is long.” Ordinary folk had responsibility for the rise and fall of the empire: “train yourself (修身), regulate your family (齐家), govern the state (治国), and bring peace to the world under heaven (平天下)”; “when promoted they made the whole world good.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_32">32</a> If that were too much, then one should at least improve oneself. Or one could work for other social values that deserved to be valued, such as loyalty. New dynasties would allow members of the political elite who had served the previous dynasty to retire. In this way, ancient China transformed the individual talent hidden in society into a resource for society, something society could share in.</p><p><em>Bo Le? Individual Talent or Systematic Selection</em></p><p>Once this social consensus was agreed on, dynasties throughout China’s history faced the issue of selecting an elite. But to implement this consensus, a number of difficulties had to be overcome, and this required a long period of slow development of a suitable system of selection.</p><p>The biggest difficulty was, in fact, not what Han Yu envisaged—something whose influence is still widespread today—namely, that “there are many horses which can run a thousand leagues but rarely is there a Bo Le.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_33">33</a> The implicit logic of Han Yu’s statement is that the key to the selection of a political elite lies in the love of talent or the capacity of the political leader himself to know a horse. It is a matter of his individual foresight and ability to choose a talented person from among the myriad persons on earth. This is illustrated in many stories taken from Chinese history that seem to prove the point, such as “Jiang Ziya went fishing by the river Wei; the fish that wanted to be caught jumped up to his hook,” “Xiao He chased after Han Xin in the moonlight,” and “Liu Bei went three times to the ruined cottage (where Zhuge Liang lived).” Hence, selection of talent was dependent on the personal virtue or wisdom of the political leader. As a result, over a long period of time people spoke as if the main means of implementing a selection of an elite was dependent on the morality of the ruler himself. He must thirst for worthy men, honoring such people with posts and choosing only talented persons, sparing nothing in his search. Second, his political judgment and insight required him to be able to discover rare persons of exceptional talent, choose, and employ them.</p><p>But this general understanding of the selection of the elite in China is wrong from the start in that it begins from the wrong point of view. Clearly, if politicians want to select talent and do so only from their own point of view, they will not only be able, but also will, tolerate some flaws or weak points in their chosen elite that would otherwise be unacceptable. Generally, they would also be able to recognize the elite—since these are virtually constructed by the politicians’ own definition. The real problem, though, and one that is not easily overcome, is that of information. How could one discover talent or get a line on where talent lies, and how could one guarantee that talent? In particular, the greatest problem is how to decide whether one person is more talented than another. Without gathering sufficient reliable information, without a judgment based on a broad range of information, especially since one cannot make a judgment about the future on actual experience gained before the appointment, it would seem to be impossible. So from this point of view, the selection of an elite is a high-risk investment. If one lacks a uniform, reliable standard, then not only does an ardent desire to seek the worthy not resolve the problem, it rather becomes a problem in its own right, even a major one. If we think of the four great dukes of the Warring States period, we find they did not turn away any comers and each of them had several thousand aspirants knocking at his door. This is a perfect illustration of an ardent search for talent, but what great things were they able to carry out? Or if we think of the countless proverbs that circulated in the Warring States period, we can say that Han Yu’s distant ancestor, Han Fei, saw the problem much more clearly.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_34">34</a> That is, all of this can only, and must only, be supplementary to a system if it is to be effective.</p><p>The selection of an elite in a large agrarian state is exceptionally difficult. In a small community, such as in the Greek city-states, people meet and work together on a regular basis and thus can more easily find and identify talented individuals. It is also easier to win consensus on who belongs to the elite; the talent of individuals is less easily hidden away.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_35">35</a> But in a large agrarian state, although there are certain to be elite persons, they may be scattered in rural communities that rarely communicate with one another and where communication and transportation are inconvenient such that people do not know one another and there is no common background or common standard of measurement. It is not possible to form a uniform standard in advance, and so no one can even talk of having an appropriate standard, and it is even harder to judge who is better than another. Indeed, even the so-called Bo Le comes from and belongs to a particular community or region, and he may not have seen much of the world and his judgment may not be much superior to another person’s. “Beyond the mountain there are yet higher mountains; beyond this building yet taller buildings”: “there is always someone of greater skill in a group of skilled persons.” In a large agrarian state, it is very difficult for anyone to truly, reliably, and authoritatively compare others or make a judgment about them. Indeed, one cannot even do so for oneself. Or, even if someone had this ability and was able to judge dispassionately, yet it would be very difficult to get everyone everywhere to believe in his authority and fairness, since authority also requires a basis in social consensus.</p><p>It is essential to establish a uniform and effective means of gathering information and making comparisons before one can overcome the lack of a uniform standard in a large state with scattered sources of information. There must be a uniform standard by which to judge, one that is sufficiently comprehensive and accurate for effective assessments to be made. But there are also other problems to be faced. First, one must let all people who consider themselves to be the elite, whether their self-assessment is objective or not, participate and only subsequently discuss their willingness and ability and then they can either voluntarily, or based on a custom, or even actively participate under this uniform measure, recognizing and accepting the authority and evenhandedness of the standard of measurement. From a theoretical point of view, none of this was possible in early China.</p><p>Furthermore, in a large state with a complex topography there are bound to be inequalities in the level of economic, political, and cultural development. This implies that even naturally gifted persons are liable to have received different degrees of education depending on their place of birth. In today’s language, we might say that from the start there was inequality of opportunity. In the past, however, inequality of opportunity was not to be seen as a matter of individual rights since people’s outlook was limited and rarely went beyond one’s own person and people like oneself, and so no one talked about equality with far-off strangers. But the inequality of opportunity was even more serious, since from the view of the structure of the state as a whole, without the participation of elite persons from all over the country or without balanced participation of all areas in the central government and in the politics of the whole state, imbalances of information and understanding about the regions on the part of the center might influence the unity of rule of that particular dynasty. Indeed, to a large extent they did so.</p><p>Moreover, we must ask what the concrete norm was. Howsoever the central government catered to the various interests, so long as there was one standard for the whole country, the factors that went into making that standard had to come from a certain place. Therefore, any uniform standard could be biased and any effort to achieve unity could lead to division rather than unity. But one could not, for this reason, either forsake the goal of establishing a uniform standard to measure what being elite meant or create a standard out of thin air. The only possibility was to take some existing local standard and try to ensure that it became the standard for the whole country. This change required sufficient time and effort to coordinate various mechanisms before the standard could silently permeate every place in the whole country and gain acceptance.</p><p>A further big problem is that of entanglement. What one wants to select is a political elite, but those who participate are military people in charge of affairs of state, war, and peace. So, it is not only a matter of assessing the wisdom and ability of the elite but also, and even more important, of examining their political affiliations and loyalty.</p><p>Political affiliation is not such a big problem for the political elite in independent city-states or small countries in ancient society, because the ideal community and the actual community in which one lives virtually coincide. But in a large state, there will arise the problem of a mismatch between the ideal and the real community and thus the demands placed on the political loyalty of the political elite will be much more complicated, and even entangled. On the one hand, the elite must be politically loyal to their employer. In the Warring States time, this was an issue.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_36">36</a> On the other hand, the politics of a large state also required the political elite, to a great extent, to overcome local interests and think of themselves as belonging to a wider society and region, to make the affairs of the empire their own. Only then could they become persons the state could employ. They would not merely represent local interests; they needed to have professional ethics that their employer could rely on, political loyalty.</p><p>Unification under the Qin and Han did away with competition between employers and simplified the political and moral issues faced by the elite. But the problem became how elites from so many places could attach primary importance to the state, the people, public affairs, and the common interest. They had to understand who the people were, what a public issue was, what the state and the world under heaven were, and what important offices were. These were all major questions that elites from all over had to gradually respond to and resolve on the basis of their cultural education and political practice. They had to learn how to view things from the perspective of society as a whole rather than local or personal interests. They had to take this stance to understand the whole and judge what was important. Political ideas, political breeding, and political loyalty mattered, rather than political opportunism and egotism. The kind of demand laid on the political elite of historical China for a political and cultural community is something that could never be provided by a city-state or even a modern European nation-state. This demand required some special qualities. There had to be special political and cultural norms and corresponding systems such that a political elite with these qualities could be fostered and formed. To guarantee that they would be effective, these norms had to win acceptance from the people being formed by them.</p><p>Summarizing all these questions, we can say that all of them seek to provide the elite with a political ability to resolve the issues raised by the political, economic, and cultural aspects of a community in a large state, or we might say that they are an important aspect of China’s constitution, for which China had to discover the preliminary systemic conditions. Because, without this basic political, economic, social, and cultural community, or if this community were unstable and liable to disappear, and there were no political or cultural boundaries imaginable, the selection of the political elite would certainly run into insuperable difficulties, such as how to set up a system for the selection or examination of the elite who were chosen or who presented themselves for examination. Without a sufficiently strong government body or reliable means of supervision, selection or examination would seem to be impossible. What interest could motivate the political and cultural elite of all places to actively move out of their home regions and cross, perhaps, a thousand mountains and ten thousand rivers, saying farewell to their relatives, setting out, and taking part in the selection process, “allowing the state to decide whom to choose”? If they did not cooperate or did not try to take part, then the selection of the elite would simply not get off the ground. Without a basic political and cultural identity, it would not seem possible to set up standards of knowledge and ability by which to undertake the selection or examination. Why use writing? Indeed, why use Chinese characters?</p><p>These questions suffice to show that the implementation of a meritocracy in historical China must have been directly related to the political framework established by the political and military measures put in place by previous dynasties and states, and that it could not have come from the political elite themselves. In other words, it was the success of unification by military conquest undertaken by the First Emperor of Qin that monopolized the market and ensured that the elite would no longer be able to turn to other rulers. Otherwise, their political ability would merely be like that of today, a commercial transaction. Their political loyalty would be reduced to a stable expectation of rewards. The unification of the script by the First Emperor of Qin, the rejection of the hundred schools and selection of the Confucians alone by Emperor Wu of the Han, and similar measures set out in this book and in the selection of the political elite in later China gained a significance that their then creators probably did not fully appreciate.</p><p>Unification of the script and preference for Confucianism alone and similar measures were very important for the selection of a political elite under subsequent dynasties. However, distant water does not slake a thirst. As a result of unification under the Qin, and even more under the Han, the problem of selecting a political elite for a large state was in fact exacerbated. The fall of the Qin thanks to the incompetence of the Second Emperor meant that no regular norms for selecting a political elite had yet emerged. In the early years of the Han, reliance was placed on the ministers who had helped to set up the state, such as Xiao He, Cao Can, Wang Ling, Chen Ping, Zhou Bo&#x2F;Bei, Guan Ying, and others, and this was not a problem in the beginning. But forty-five years later, under Emperor Jing, there were no such capable ministers to be found and thus the problem of finding successors became all too apparent. The only thing to do was to employ the sons of the previous officials, such as Zhou Yafu and Liu She. By the time of Emperor Wu of the Han, the sparsity of talent had become pressing. Emperor Wu therefore sought a political elite among his distant relatives on a large scale, such that Sima Qian added a chapter for the biographies of distant relatives to his <em>Historical Records</em>. This use of distant relatives became an outstanding feature of politics under the two Han dynasties.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_37">37</a> On his accession, Emperor Wu appointed Dou Ying, the nephew (<em>zhi-er</em>) of his father’s empress Dou as prime minister and made his own uncle (<em>jiujiu</em>), Tian Fen, grand commandant and later prime minister. Some of the most important appointments under Emperor Wu were given to people of good repute and ability, but on close examination, even persons such as Wei Qing and Huo Qubing or the later Li Guangli all turned out to be his brothers-in-law (<em>xiaojiuzi</em>). Huo Guang, the minister appointed by Emperor Wu to assist his young son Emperor Zhao after his death, was also a brother-in-law.</p><p>These stories show that Emperor Wu tended to appoint relatives, but they may also show that his approach to choosing talented people did not stick to a fixed pattern.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_38">38</a> Proof lies in the case of Wei Qing, who had once been a slave, and the genius Huo Qubing, who was very young when chosen. Moreover, before his death, Emperor Wu named Jin Midi as a high minister (<em>fuming dachen</em>). He was a Xiongnu who had been forced to surrender to the Han and been made a palace slave. Emperor Wu discovered him by accident and gradually formed him and shaped him into a politician for the Han dynasty.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_39">39</a> But these few people were all close to the emperor himself and thus could be found and employed by him. Among persons who were not so close to him we could perhaps list Wei Qing or Huo Qubing, Huo Guang or Jin Midi.</p><p>But the legitimate expectations of a political leader such as Emperor Wu of the Han could not be satisfied by measures that did not go beyond their time or society at the time in identifying and choosing the most outstanding people in the whole country. Rather, in the conditions imposed on him, he could, and did, find and select the most outstanding persons possible. Thus, this demonstrates Emperor Wu’s ability to spot talent, but it also demonstrates the paucity of political talent in his time. The Han had ruled for sixty years when he acceded to the throne, but the dynasty had not yet developed a system to select talent and was forced to rely on the personal acumen of the emperor himself. The Western Han desperately longed for the establishment of an effective system for attracting and selecting the elite from the whole country to take part in the political governance of the state.</p><p>Here is an issue that people today are apt to overlook: if the central government could not attract a sufficient number of gifted persons, this would imply not only that people would not be able to perform according to their talent but also that there would be an even greater danger, namely, that some of the political elite would be attracted by the feudal princes and form political forces that would rival or even oppose the central government. This would be a great disservice to the stability and unity of the state. The ability of Liu An, king of Huainan, to attract a cultural elite in the early years of the Han is something that later generations admired. In certain respects, the influence of Liu An’s political and cultural thought eclipsed that of the central government of his time.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_40">40</a> Even though the central government had a hold on the essentials and Emperor Wu himself had sufficient political clout, the problems are, first, that reliance on individual political clout alone cannot guarantee the regime will stand for long, and, second, there is no assurance that later emperors would have Emperor Wu’s talent, clout, or authority. For these reasons, it was necessary to open up channels by which the political elite could take part in state politics and enable the state to use the human resources of the whole country more fully. Thus, in historical China, a meritocracy must be a constitutional issue.</p><p><em>Selections</em> (tuiju), <em>Recommendations</em> (chaju), <em>and Examinations</em> (keju)</p><p>In this section, we will discover that it was in fact starting in the time of Emperor Wu that efforts for the selection of talent were for the first time systematized and placed on a long-term basis. We also will discuss how this system was implemented, what conditions—unalterable at the time—it was based on, what kind of measures were adopted, and to what concrete issues they corresponded. Only after a period of some 750 years as a result of the accumulation of scattered efforts was it possible for these efforts to crystalize in the great system of imperial examinations.</p><p>Before Emperor Wu, Emperor Wen had issued a decree calling for recommendations from the whole country of “worthy persons who could speak honestly as advisors.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_41">41</a> But it was only under Emperor Wu that the most important institution, the appointment system, was set up to attract the elite to participate in politics. Emperor Wu, first, “ordered the provinces and commanderies to select officials who were exceptionally talented and might be made generals or sent as ambassadors.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_42">42</a> This “opened wide the road for talented and worthy persons and welcomed scholars of all disciplines.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_43">43</a> But Emperor Wu still accepted the advice of Dong Zhongshu to employ Confucians only and thus did not allow Legalists or Strategists to participate.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_44">44</a></p><p>There were largely two kinds of persons recommended to the court by different localities. The first was a percentage of the population of each commandery and “state” chosen from among virtuous persons who sought to implement Confucian morality. The second was outstanding persons of each region recommended by the high ministers and officials. The persons put forward included not only officials themselves but also virtuous persons from among the common people. The central government examined or employed the persons recommended on a trial basis. They were asked to suggest strategies for dealing with important political and social matters, and those who replied the best were chosen for service in the empire or were kept at the palace to work beside the emperor as <em>langguan</em> (staff officials). In addition, the Han dynasty also recruited specially skilled persons to be sent to work on the western frontier or to look after rivers and such technical matters. They could be recommended by others or could apply themselves.</p><p>The persons recommended had to finally undergo an examination by the emperor himself before their appointment. Perhaps legal philosophers today would say that this laid too much stress on the will of the officials and is a classic form of personal rule. But when it is compared to the previous unsystematized selection of talent, this form of recommendation was normalized and so was, in fact, rule by law. In particular, the selection of the Confucians took place once a year at a fixed time and in time came to replace other informal institutions that lacked such periodic timing. Furthermore, since Emperor Wu ordered that the high palace officials and local officials should recommend talented persons, the task of selection became the legal responsibility of government officials at all levels and entered into the agenda of government work. To a certain extent, this expanded the channels and opportunities by which persons of various talents could participate in politics and even more of the elite were able, as a result, to look forward to entering the government of the state. The final exam before the emperor was only one essential element in the selection process. It manifested the importance attached to selection by the highest authorities and their concern. It pertains to a necessary institutional measure that reinforced the central authority of the leaders and thus augmented the prestige of the center in the hearts of the people.</p><p>The choice of Confucianism must also be understood from the point of view of the institutional measures to select talent and at the level of the national constitution. This is, of course, because Confucian thought conforms to the essential social control and internal order of agrarian society itself.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_45">45</a> The ethical norms of Confucianism regarding personal morality, the family, the state, and the world as a whole are able to negotiate effectively between the family and the state and thus made a substantive contribution to the society and political governance. Hence, previous scholars are right to have understood Dong Zhongshu’s suggestion as arising from his political concern to unite the state. But one leaf can blind the eye. This angle greatly underestimates this suggestion since the institutional significance and historic import of its implementation are much broader and deeper. If we start from the issues raised in this chapter, then we will discover that the adoption of Confucianism alone was, in fact, the first step in standardizing the state selection of a political elite. It unified the topics for the state exams and determined their scope and led to intellectual investment by the whole of society. From an objective point of view, cultural investment won out over the efforts of other schools. However, this does not mean that it sought to put down other schools of thought and culture.</p><p>Contention among different schools of thought is a standard mechanism that provokes human beings to think, but it is not a means for assessing and choosing talented persons. The two do not go together. Even in the most tolerant and accepting society, an examination cannot be tolerant and accepting: some people will pass and others fail. If examinations were created according to the Mohist school, then that would be unfair to other schools of thought. Even if the exams were all based on Daoism, if the topic was Zhuangzi, then that would be unfair to the disciples of Laozi, or an exam according to the <em>Mencius</em> would be unfair to the students of the <em>Xunzi</em>. If the exam was to be written in Chinese, then the native languages of non-Chinese students would be unacceptable. Although competition among the schools may be fair, in itself it cannot produce a uniform system of selection that could win the confidence of the public. Without any such system of selection, no one would willingly come forward to take part in the selection.</p><p>Therefore, the long-term historical contribution of the choice of Confucianism alone must be understood in terms of the long river of history. It is not only a matter of that time, or of the following few decades, but something that becomes obvious only some 750 years later, namely, the fundamental contribution that the choice of Confucianism alone made to the implementation of the institution of imperial examinations. In accordance with this cultural investment and its gradual permeation of every place in the country and at every level of society, the set texts for the whole country were slowly unified, and thus what the scholars studied was unified and standardized, as a result of which it was ultimately possible to establish a universally acceptable, statewide standardized test and system of evaluation for scholars in the whole country. Once this is understood it will be possible to appreciate that the choice of Confucianism alone, with the tradition of Confucius and Mencius as the mainstream—although since modern times this measure has generally been reckoned as unfavorable to the development of traditional Chinese thought and culture—was, in fact, a contribution of great and far-reaching significance to the cultural development of the Chinese people and their establishment of institutions.</p><p>Of course, some scholars might object that this measure could equally well be applied to other schools and encouraged them to develop too and thus increase cultural investment. Put like this, it seems that failure to do so is a price China had to pay, and hence it was a loss. But what is required here is not a simple judgment: was this a loss on the abstract level? That would be something everyone knows could be done. But this would be a complicated, delicate balance and, given that China then lacked the requisite personnel and was under the constraints imposed by the lack of other resources, whether historical China could have benefitted institutionally from other cultural institutions is a moot point. So this loss may be worthwhile.</p><p>The gains need to be viewed over the long term. Whatever the case, the Han dynasty was unable to reap the benefits. Emperor Wu was faced with a dire shortage of men and, leaving aside the long-term institutional view, he required an immediate solution. The measures he put in place were the countrywide recommendation procedure and the imperial academy, which was also founded in his time. According to Qian Mu, these two institutions were responsible for China’s political turnaround. There were more than one hundred commanderies in the Han Empire, and each year more than two hundred worthy candidates were recommended. They entered the place to serve there as <em>langguan</em>. Soon, these scholars included people from all the commanderies of the empire and perhaps more than half of them attended the imperial academy. Some decades later, among those who passed the central government selection, the best were appointed officials of the central government while the rest were sent home to work as local officials. Gradually, officials of all ranks under the Han became either scholars themselves or at least people who had been educated. According to the uniform regulation of the laws and decrees issued by the central government, governance was thus made firm.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_46">46</a></p><p>At the time and for a considerable period afterward, the recommendation system was the most feasible system possible under the social conditions of the time and in this sense was the best way of choosing practical and able persons. Since at the time the scholars of the whole country could not possibly have been formed against a uniform intellectual background or scholarly tradition, there being no stable academic tradition or intellectual framework built on such a tradition, any other form of testing or examination of culture and knowledge could not have been implemented. Students, examiners, and those who put in recommendations could not have managed. Another important restraining factor is that, as is generally understood, the manufacture of paper began to develop only under the Eastern Han and so only from that moment on did the use of paper begin to become widespread. Hence, for this reason, universal written exams would have been basically impossible under the Western Han.</p><p>Given such social conditions, the opportunity to study would necessarily have been unevenly distributed in society. This inequality would certainly have nothing to do with people’s natural intellectual capacity, but would be related to whether someone from a previous generation had studied, whether there were books at home, or even if they could be bought or copied. It would depend on whether one’s family was well-off and, even more, on whether someone in one’s family had been in politics and on one’s relationship to dominant families (<em>menfa shizu</em>). Faced with such conditions, the choice of the elite by a written exam might well be even more unfair than the recommendation system. At least in the first stages, recommendation by local and central government officials would be a better institutional option. You might even say that the role of this institution was one of a division of power between the local and central governments and a way of choosing a political elite who would perform checks on each other.</p><p>The biggest disadvantage of the recommendation system—as was to be seen later—lay in that, since the power to choose whom to employ rested in the central government, although talented persons could be recommended by officials of all the commanderies and those in the highest posts, recommending persons naturally fell easily to the local clans and high officials, leading to local affiliations and dominant families. By the late Eastern Han, the recommendation system was played and used by the cliques who controlled popular opinion and brought about all kinds of corruption.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_47">47</a> Political ethics and political logic clearly demanded a reform of the system. But what really made reform necessary was not political ethics or logic, but rather the rising of the Yellow Turbans in the closing years of the Eastern Han and the local separatism and years of war and chaos that followed. The population of the north declined considerably, and this meant that local districts were no longer able to recommend talented persons and the central government was unable to send persons to all parts of the country.</p><p>In these social circumstances, the state of Wei, in the Three Kingdoms period, created a central institution of nine grades of officials. This was in fact another version of the recommendation system, the difference being that it weakened the power exercised by local areas in selecting talent and strengthened the control and examination of the nominees by the center. The <em>chaju</em> system thus became the key institution for selecting officials during the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern dynasties. In practice, this system meant that the court chose worthy and competent officials for all posts at the local level in the prefectures, commanderies, and counties to inspect the scholars of their localities and assign ranks to them on the basis of their families—depending on the posts occupied by fathers or grandfathers and according to the rank held—personal virtue, and talent. These ranks were used as a reference by the Ministry of Personnel (<em>Li bu</em>). Assignment of rank should mainly depend on virtue and talent, with family background being merely for reference. However, under the Wei and the Jin dynasties virtually all the central posts were held by dominant families who controlled the selection by the ministry. In assigning rank, talent and virtue gradually moved into second place while family background rose to the fore and even became the only criterion. By the Western Jin, it was said that “high-ranking persons never lacked visitors; low-ranking persons had no power.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_48">48</a> The institution of nine grades by the center failed to effectively strengthen the control of the center over the choice of talent. Moreover, it sustained and reinforced the rule of the local dominant families and was itself an important part of the system of dominant families. The recommendation system that had once been a reform of the institution for selecting a political elite had itself become in need of reform.</p><p>When the Sui restored unity in the country, they sought to strengthen the central authority and reform politics. One measure that they used was to abolish recommendation and replace it with the institution of imperial examinations. In 587, Emperor Wen of the Sui decreed that each prefecture was to send three persons each year to take part in the <em>xiucai</em> exam, though artisans and traders were not to take part. In 605, Emperor Yang of the Sui began to use the <em>jinshi</em> exam to choose officials. This is generally reckoned to be the beginning of the <em>keju</em> (examination) system that was to last thirteen hundred years.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_49">49</a></p><p>Overall, it is accepted that there were two political measures that led to the historic transition from the recommendation system of selecting talent to the examination system. The first is that the Sui abolished the middle administrative level of the prefectures, commanderies, and counties and thus reduced the tiers of government. This measure cut the ground from under the system of recommendation of talent by the commanderies that had been in place since the Western Han. The second is that the Sui strengthened the central authority. Under the Sui, officials in the prefectures and counties were not permitted to name their subordinates themselves since this task was assigned to the Ministry of Personnel and thus coordinated by the center. This meant that the central government had to find another reliable and effective way of choosing even more officials. But aside from this, one important premise lay in the culture of society, namely, that the practice of central government from the Qin and Han onward included unification of the script and promotion of the refined language of the central plain. These measures had already accumulated cultural results at the institutional level in society. Moreover, the more than seven hundred years of institutional practice of the selection of officials by the selection and recommendation systems begun by Emperor Wu of the Han as well as the choice of Confucianism alone had already spread throughout the whole country and had gradually penetrated all levels of society. Taken together, this was an important institutional condition for the foundation of a system of selection of a political and cultural elite that was wholly dependent on writing, independent of other social interest groups, and completely under the central government. A statewide standard was also provided that ensured the social environment within which the imperial examinations could take place.</p><p>Compared to the selection system of the Han dynasty and the recommendation system of the Wei and Jin, a special characteristic of the imperial examination system is that scholars applied of their own free will and success or failure was largely decided by their score on the written exam. From a constitutional point of view, the main institutional change was that it strengthened the central government’s control of the selection of talent, meaning that the various levels or groupings of power in society no longer had an <em>institutional influence</em> on social mobility and political selection of talent. Every scholar, wherever he was born, whether rich or poor, if he wanted to, could aspire, mainly by his own effort and relying on his own ability, to compete for a share in the political governance of the state. For ordinary people, this set out a clear, standardized direction for cultural capital investment equally beneficial for the family and the state and encouraged the creation and accumulation of the Chinese script as a form of capital for society. Thanks to institutional aggregation through the dynasties, including the affirmation of a central power for the political unity of the whole country, and also including a unified script, Mandarin Chinese, and Confucianism as the sole school of thought, the central government acquired in society a statewide source of talent of comparatively unified standardized virtue and one that would never run dry. The central government of the monarchy could begin to permeate society, resulting in its political legitimacy reaching to all levels of society, even to the bottom layer.</p><p>By means of the imperial examination system, and thanks to individual and family pursuit of secular renown and income, and the pursuit of the Confucian ideals for personal morality, the family (家), state (国), and the world under heaven (天下) as a whole, the political and cultural elite of each place were shaped into a statewide network and community that came from the localities but no longer simply belonged to them. They did not need to rely on the rich and powerful, nor did they need to rely very much on high officials or men of importance, but could directly look to the imperial power and be loyal to it. Even if they were far from the court in remote places, by means of the Confucian political and cultural norms built up over the years the scholars were able to see things as a whole. They were incapable of failing to love the state and would never fail to set their sights on the entire world under heaven. They were the product of the political and cultural unity of China and also the guarantee of that political and cultural unity. With them the culture was united and with them there was hope of maintaining political unity.</p><p>Thanks to the selection of scholars through the institution of the imperial examinations, which transformed the bureaucracy from the uppermost to the lowest levels of government, and to political governance by means of official documents, a government by writing (<em>wenzhi</em>) was implemented, which is Max Weber’s sense of the rule of law. Even scholars who lay outside this bureaucracy—whether they had not yet or could not join, or had retired or even been dismissed—were still members of the local elite and hence of the political elite. This was the “power of the gentry” (<em>shenquan</em>) that helped ensure the cleanliness of local politics and the spread and unification of culture, and for this reason it later became an important force in local politics in China.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_50">50</a></p><p>Is it any surprise that in the first year of his reign, on seeing the students filing out of the examination hall, Emperor Taizong of the Tang sighed, “The heroes of the whole world have all fallen into my net!”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_51">51</a></p><p>Indeed, only after founding a statewide, unified institution for selection of the elite could the statements “talent alone is raised up” and “there is no exception in the matter of talent” be affirmed in a constitutional sense. It was but a form of auxiliary institution or reinforcement of the institution. Its significance did not lie in the norm by which only talent was selected, but rather in that by selection in a strict elite exam, an emergency door remained, creating room for maneuver so that in times of necessity there could be exceptions to the talent-only rule. This was not only because any institution has its loopholes and the institution was suited to selecting the elite but not talent, and the like, but, even more important, because it was not easy to standardize a test for the <em>selection of a political elite</em>. Written examinations tend to prioritize intelligence, cleverness, and a good memory, such that people with these abilities can more easily pass. These skills are very important, but people with such abilities are not necessarily the political elite or capable of becoming so, because the core requirement for a political elite is to be of use to the times.</p><p><em>To Be of Use to the Times</em></p><p>All forms of selection—the search for worthy people, the selections, recommendations, and examinations—were but steps in ancient China’s meritocracy. In terms of politics, who is chosen and in whatever way, the ultimate problem to be faced is very practical: Okay, they are talented, but do they really have the ability to govern the state effectively? Can they truly solve and handle major political questions?</p><p>This has to do with the nature of politics. Politics demands wisdom and ability, but even more, practical reason rather than pure reason. One plus one equals two: that is pure reason. The answer is absolutely right. Practical reason, however, may be assessed orally or in writing, but any such assessment can never be accurate. A person who speaks well cannot necessarily act well. The best form of assessment is in doing and in practice.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_52">52</a> Moreover, this action or practice cannot be like the assessment of martial arts carried out on the stage: Chinese people very early on realized that “writing does not come first.” Thus, the various forms of selecting a political elite (the selection, recommendation, and examination systems)—although they may have been the best possible forms under the social conditions, such that one could not do without them—proved to be not very reliable.</p><p>Second, unlike other social practices that to a high degree rely on practical reason—such as driving, swimming, or athletics—political governance does not deal only with the self; even more important, it is always concerned with the lives and families of the broad mass of all the people. “One false step leads to a thousand ancient hatreds.” Politics has a broad and profound influence and hence political governance brooks no failures. It does not accept the kind of logic exemplified in “failure is the mother of success” or “one fall is but a step in wisdom.” This does not imply that one cannot go wrong or that an individual cannot gain lessons of experience from his practice. Rather, it means that in dealing with important questions in one’s official capacity there is no second chance. Since it is political responsibility that is assumed, the demands for virtue laid on the political elite are always for prudence, confidentiality, <em>a sense of proportionality</em> (分寸感), and sometimes even conservativeness. In a large state, these issues are magnified because the sphere of interest of any political decision or the influence of any action is larger and the number of people affected greater.</p><p>In a large state with a vast territory, rather than in a little republic like a city-state, it is exceedingly troublesome to select a political elite with the practical ability to run a large state from an innumerable throng of strangers—and not from among very reduced minority groups such as the dominant families of the Wei-Jin period or from among the nobles in medieval Europe. Moreover, this had to be done by means of oral or written examinations. The problem is no longer whether the selected persons belong to the elite, but, insofar as it is possible to select potential talent from the whole country, one must use a standardized system of testing—including the selection and recommendation systems, and especially the imperial examinations with all their many constituent institutions and detailed systems, such as testing by the emperor or by the court, whether orally or by other methods. In all cases the emphasis is on wisdom and knowledge that depend on written texts, and even more on literary and oral expression. The tendency is to prefer elite persons who are good at reciting texts by heart, have a good memory, and are good at taking exams and using words. In other words, even though it was known that these forms of testing would not be able to assess the practical reasoning of the elite, for the sake of legitimacy and evenhandedness, it was necessary to adopt and hold firm to these systems that had proven to be biased. What was chosen was a cultural elite, among whom were undoubtedly a political elite, but as to who was politically talented and who was not, that could not be known, or at least not with any certainty. It was also very unclear how the ability that emerged from selection through exams and the practical reason required for running the state were related. At least we may suppose that, in general, since scholars who passed the exams were very attentive to the use of words, so too they might be more aware in other areas too. Intelligent people always have a greater chance of passing exams, and so it is reasonable to believe that those who had been through several levels of strict testing and exams would, generally speaking, have a higher level of ability and intelligence than those who failed or did not even sit for the exams. But this also implies that when the level of intelligence of those who passed was much the same, the persons who would shine in an examination system would be those who studied <em>hard</em>, those who held to the belief that “talent lay in effort,” who were not lazy and hence might well be dogmatists (<em>benben zhuyi</em>), and less probably those who thought that “it is better to be without books than to have only books” or whose great ambition meant that they sought to read more than the set texts.</p><p>The ancient Chinese realized very soon that if the selection of talent was overly dependent on literary dogmatism, then this could have serious consequences, and so (as I noted earlier), as a rear guard or an antidote for the political elite, Chinese society always maintained a kind of anti-intellectual tradition. The classic example, which is still not forgotten today, is the tragic appointment in the Warring States period of Zhao Guo simply because he had only read books on war.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_53">53</a> Later generations were always careful to avoid confusing knowledge with ability or intelligence with ability.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_54">54</a> From the beginning the problem of practical reason may be said to have been involved in the selection and training of China’s political elite. How could one set up, or according to what could one set up, objective, fair, and reliable systems of formulas to test, identify, and distinguish the political elite effectively? How could one guarantee that only the talented would be selected and only the worthy employed? “In choosing from outsiders one would not exclude one’s enemies and from insiders one would not exclude one’s sons.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_55">55</a> This is a great difficulty. Let it not be forgotten that in the Warring States period, Prince Meng Chang, Prince Ping Yuan, Prince Xin Ling, and Prince Chun Shen all had thousands of hangers-on, which even numbered as many as 0.1 percent of the population of the whole state<img src="/../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_56" alt="56"> This does not necessarily indicate that these princes longed for worthy retainers. Rather, it may show that they were unable to effectively identify and test for talent. All they could do was to turn no one away and accept all comers as their only method of response.</p><p>But acceptance of all comers is not a virtue. At best it is but a substitute for virtue. To put it another way, it is false. For example, when examining a topic based on strict reason there may be a margin of error permissible, but this margin should never be made public. One cannot say that “one plus one equals two” should also allow that “one plus one equals three.” Accepting all comers will not necessarily improve politics. In fact, it is unable to guarantee that “each one will get a post according to his talent.” There are also other bad consequences. A lowering of the criterion for talent will mean that genuinely talented persons will be even less likely to stand out. It was because of this that Mao Sui did not stand out and had to recommend himself.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_57">57</a> Failing to turn away all comers and accepting all also leads to a vast waste of resources while truly talented people fail to earn a livelihood. Feng Huan complained that Prince Meng Chang gave too low a salary and said, “far better to go back home.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_58">58</a> The saying “a gentleman-scholar will die for his close friend” was commonplace during the Warring States period perhaps because it reflects the sighs and sense of loss of some whose treatment was too paltry.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_59">59</a> Even Han Fei’s lament may not be such a bad outcome. Even worse was that at key moments they would get major things wrong. We need only think of Qin Wuyang, who frightened the people of Yan such that they “did not dare to look at him without trembling,” as a result of which he was highly regarded by Crown Prince Dan, but when he himself had to deal with affairs he trembled all over and his face turned pale.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_60">60</a></p><p>It is in the light of this that the issue of names and realities is not a purely academic exercise. In fact, it is really a question of political practice, which was understood differently though equally well in actual practice by Confucians and Legalists. Confucians emphasized the family education and personal training of persons with practical talent, stressing their competence in managing themselves, their family, the state, and the world under heaven, highlighting “every day I examine myself three times,” paying attention to overcoming the self and returning to the rites,<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_61">61</a> and training in political morality. Legalists, however, stressed rigorous testing and selection for the political elite. Guan Zhong stressed “weighing up ability before assigning posts.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_62">62</a> Han Fei said that the prince should “assign posts on the basis of proven competence and assess results by looking at the title of the post assigned.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_63">63</a> They were concerned with the practical ability of the political elite and their actual abilities rather than their reputation or certificates. This form of very practical thought continued to be used by later generations.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_64">64</a> The key was to choose people who really had the talent to work in politics.</p><p>When implemented at the institutional level, this led to two basic systems or traditions. The first was to encourage <em>officials with practical experience in politics</em> to make recommendations of talented people to higher levels. For this reason, we can understand why Emperor Wu of the Han “ordered the heads of commanderies and prefectures to select elite persons from among the officials and ordinary people who could be sent to distant parts of the empire,” why he called on higher officials, such as magistrates and feudal lords, to recommend outstanding persons. The nine degrees of mandarinate in the central system of the Wei and Jin, which later came under attack, was at least very reasonable at the time when it was first set up. One important reason for this was that high officials of virtue serving in the central government were also made inspectors and were responsible for examining the state of scholarship in their native regions. One advantage of the recommendation and <em>chaju</em> systems was that, generally speaking, the executive heads at each level of government not only normally had to be intelligent and capable, but also, owing to practical experience gained in long-term governance of one region or direction of some major central government department, tended to pay more attention to practical experience when faced with selecting the elite. They looked at the ability to form judgments and resolve issues. They stressed an ability for synthesis, fairness, and coordination. This was in preference to the tendency of the imperial examination system to overemphasize book knowledge and memory. Moreover, practice built up over a long time ensured that these officials frequently retained this insight and good judgment.</p><p>Like the ability in pure reasoning, an ability in practical reasoning may well be in part a natural gift and may not be something that can be either <em>acquired</em> or greatly improved by study or sheer effort. We are not simply Isaac Newtons who have read too little, or Mao Zedongs who have failed to put in enough effort, or Michael Jordans who have gone astray. Yet long-term, comprehensive, and varied political practice may give rise to, or even intensify, inherent practical reason in a person that originally could not be fully displayed in a written exam. It may help others to judge one’s executive ability correctly. Sometimes this experience may also increase the self-confidence of persons who have a decided natural gift for practical reason. With rich experience and skill perfected in practice, their ability will be strengthened. Based on this point, since ancient times China has supported another even more important institution of a meritocracy, namely, to select persons who at the bottom level have been outstanding administrators in one department, to let them accumulate experience by working up through the grades until they can finally be entrusted with an important key political post. Thus, as far as possible, the selection of key officials from within the court is to be avoided—from what today we would describe as desk or secretarial posts. This idea is classically best exemplified in Han Fei’s “in the bureaucracy of an enlightened ruler the prime minister has come up from the post of district magistrate and the renowned generals have risen from the ranks. For the officials of a clear-sighted lord, the prime minister should come from the post of district magistrate; the general of the army from among the foot-soldiers.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_65">65</a></p><p>Later Chinese experience shows that dynasties throughout history were careful to appoint outstanding local officials as prime minister. At the same time, they also often specially chose officials who were in charge of one post at court as the executive officials in the localities. “The renown of the two Han dynasties (East and West) was above all due to the importance attached to the head of a commandery.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_66">66</a> In the Tang there was even a clear directive ordering an exchange between officials of the capital and of the localities. Talented persons selected from among the officials in the capital were sent to the localities as minor officials (<em>ce li</em>) and inspectors (<em>du du</em>), while minor officials and inspectors who had proved themselves in the localities were appointed to central government posts in each province (<em>sheng</em>), department (<em>bu</em>), <em>yuan</em>, and desk (<em>tai</em>). Furthermore, this system was institutionalized.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_67">67</a> It was also decreed that when an important post fell vacant in the central government, the candidate to be chosen should have had experience as head of a commandery; a vacancy at the middle level was to be filled by a former county magistrate; and persons who had served as neither head of a commandery nor county magistrate were not to be appointed to important posts such as admonitor (<em>jianyi daifu</em>) or <em>zhongshu sheren</em>. These ideas and ways of acting were generally upheld in political practice from that time on.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_68">68</a></p><p>While upholding the system of statewide standardized imperial examinations as the basis, the purpose of these regulations was to pay attention to assessment and foster ability in practical reason and to take account of political experience at all levels, so that heads of the executive at all levels should all have basic work experience and capacity in at least one field, understand the lower echelons, realize where problems lay, appreciate the hopes of the ordinary people, and be familiar with all levels of the bureaucracy and their norms of working, and so be able to discover problems early on and have the capacity to solve them, to ensure that policies adhered more closely to realities at the lowest level and to the needs of society, thus being both apt and practical. In particular, it was necessary to avoid that under the power of the center—since the heads of the executive came from outside and their subordinates were generally local people—there should easily or frequently happen the phenomenon described in the phrase “the official is as pure as water; his subordinates are as thick as oil.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_69">69</a></p><p>Frequent assessment is not simply a matter of one test and verification or of allowing the political elite to show their ability and so provide an adequate foretaste of their ability to lead and guide the whole district and to enable them to gain prestige in the world, in the bureaucracy and among the people. In this sense, it can be seen as a replacement for elections. This form of selecting the <em>jinshi</em> guaranteed that China’s political elite did not just become hangers-on, holders of paper documents, or merely academically qualified nobles. Hence, it is part of historical China’s effective constitution.</p><p>It is very difficult to assess how far this practice was effective, but indirect evidence can be found in a political and cultural phenomenon: the political elite and the cultural elite after the Wei-Jin period began to take separate paths. Therefore, there was the saying “Wind and waves have their set time; one day I shall certainly hoist my sail and sail across the blue sea.” And the sigh Li Bai applied to himself: “climbing up the mountains full of snow requires crossing the Yellow River and the frozen passes.” There also appeared the determination of Du Fu, “Above Yao and Shun, the wind …” such that in the end one can but “know the dusty red world, flowers embroider the officials in the city.” Also, although in later years some of the elite straddled politics and culture, they were few in number and, at least by the Tang, there began to emerge something close to the modern sense of a specialized or professional community of poets or cultural specialists. There were even disappointed groups of literati, which impelled the rise of the Song <em>huaben</em>, the Yuan mixed drama, and the novels of the Ming and Qing. This perhaps proves that the institution of the selection of China’s political elite in later times had achieved adequate discriminatory ability.</p><p><em>The Politics beyond Meritocracy</em></p><p>In reflecting on meritocracy at the constitutional level, it is obviously necessary to discuss the political elite. But meritocracy is an institutional matter and may easily be read as—but it certainly should not be confused with or, even worse, treated as identical to—rule by a political elite. The latter is far more a case of individual members of the elite or at the most only a particular community of the elite.</p><p>For example, a meritocracy must rely on selection according to individual talent. This is very important, but it is not the whole story. Because the key issue for political governance may well be said to be to bring together a balance among the various groups in society whose interests have sufficient legitimacy and necessity to exist, and a balance between the interests of individual interest groups. From there it is possible to uphold and consolidate the unity of the country and social stability. For the vast agrarian society with its scattered communities that was historical China, the political, economic, and cultural links between the periphery and the center were not very close, nor could they easily be so. Hence, maintaining the unity of the country and political stability in society naturally had its own inherent particularity. The role of a meritocracy was to promote and constantly remain subordinate to this goal. The whole class of scholars was the political and cultural institutional product of the promotion of this goal. At the same time, they were also an important means for promoting and implementing this goal. These members of the elite belonged to China but also had deep roots in their own locality and had a profound influence on their place of birth. They were the nerves running from top to bottom of the state. Therefore, to implement this goal and develop a meritocracy, it was necessary—for the good of the whole state and keeping in mind the good of the periphery—and essential and also feasible to express local interests by means of the institutionalization of the political elite in each place by collecting and transmitting important information about every place, and thus promoting the political, economic, and cultural integration of the whole country.</p><p>This implies that meritocracy could not be simple. At certain times, if some specific ways of doing things in a meritocracy do not serve the implementation of this goal, then they might bring about misunderstanding between interest groups at the local, regional, or even higher levels, resulting in increased divisions and more intensive contradictions, such that the institution must be adjusted. At such times, the elite must move in the direction of political compromise, and they will do so. It would not be the case that politics would move toward a political compromise in favor of the elite. All this is latent as a subordinate theme running alongside the <em>language</em> of a meritocracy. Even more important, pragmatism both in China and in other countries must consider that in political <em>implementation</em> this must be the principal consideration. In other words, meritocracy never seeks to implement the rule of the philosopher kings.</p><p>In this section we will explore and highlight something that has for a long time been concealed in the constitution of historical China, but that at least since the selection of the political elite in the time of Emperor Wu of the Han has, indeed, always been patently obvious in the implementation of political integration for a large agrarian state, though subordinate to, or arising from, what has been said earlier about the selection system of ancient China’s political elite. What it seeks, within the framework of the constitution of a united state, is to form the political structure of this country, to strive for balance and compromise and the creation of conditions sufficient for the political elite in each place to actively and actually participate in the central government and the political governance of the whole country, directly or indirectly expressing and transmitting information about local interests. This is very important for the effective running of a united country. It is, indeed, not based on representative democracy. Nor is it a matter of rubbing a touch of elitism into democratic rule. Rather, it is to add to meritocracy some elements of representation. Let it be noted: the aim here is not to try to seek some form of democracy in the political practice of ancient China. In my view, that way of proceeding is a waste of time and quite unreliable. What I say is that, in those times, this was the most reasonable and most necessary institution for the formation and integration of agrarian China. In fact, I do not care in the least if it is some kind of democracy or not!</p><p>Let us go back to those times in history. Emperor Wu of the Han sent out a decree ordering each commandery to recommend one person who was filial and one who was worthy.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_70">70</a> When some commanderies failed to comply, he sent a further decree urging full compliance, at the risk of deviating from the center and&#x2F;or indicating that the officials in the commandery were incompetent and should be dismissed.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_71">71</a> Later on, the emperor also ruled that talented persons should be selected according to the population of each commandery, an initial and rather crude form of proportional representation.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_72">72</a></p><p>The question is why there was a call for distribution according to commanderies or, later, according to the size of population in each commandery. If the focus was solely on selecting a political elite, then surely <em>talent</em> should be the <em>only</em> criterion. Distributing the pool amounts to restricting numbers and thus is unreasonable. Or perhaps the commanderies should recommend all the elite persons they have, and the center should then make a choice. Or the center could fix a total number, pay no attention to which commandery they were from, and set some standardized way by which the requisite number could be uniformly employed. It is unreasonable to take the commandery as a unit and for it to put forward only one person. It is slightly more reasonable when later commanderies were divided into three sizes, large, medium, and small, and selection was according to the size of population. But this too supposes that talent is always evenly distributed among the population, yet an even distribution of talent in the population, especially educated talent, not only then but even today is not the norm.</p><p>Furthermore, when the commanderies failed to fulfill their duty, why did Emperor Wu think that the local officials were at variance with the center or that they were incompetent? Why did he not ask that local officials recommend talent based on the facts and ask them to be responsible for working strictly, rather than fabricating the numbers just to fill up the request of the central government? We have reason to think that political, economic, cultural, and educational development in each local jurisdiction was uneven and that the natural and social reserves of the political and cultural elite were certainly not the same everywhere. The facts prove that under pressure from the central government there came about what was popularly mocked as “recommending ‘outstanding’ persons who read no books; recommending ‘worthy’ persons whose fathers must leave home and live elsewhere.” Surely, Emperor Wu understood the simple wisdom of “when the superior has a preference; inferiors will certainly go overboard in toadying to it.”</p><p>He understood all right, but he did not care. This reveals Emperor Wu’s unbending insistence on political pursuits and a greater political equilibrium, something that was founded solely on the basic premise behind the selection of elite and talented persons in politics and culture who came from every local area. What he sought was, first, that whether talent was distributed evenly or not, what passed for the political elite of <em>each place in the whole country</em> (even if they were not strictly of the political elite), could, in some way or other, take part in the political governance of the state. Second, he hoped, through the united hearts and minds of all local officials, and according to the political framework and channels of the state, to implement this political goal. The aim was to ensure that his dynasty truly brought together the political elite of the whole country and formed a political community that stretched from top to bottom, east to west, and north to south. At the same time, by means of this community and the mechanism of the state, he could train and shape a political elite that would be influential in each place, and thus comprehensively augment the political and cultural cohesiveness and esprit de corps of the court.</p><p>If this were merely the request of Emperor Wu of the Han, then perhaps it could be interpreted as merely accidental. If someone alleged that it was the emperor’s personal preference, then that would be hard to challenge. But 750 years later, when the imperial examinations were set up, Emperor Wen of the Sui also asked each prefecture to present three people annually for the exams. This is to set the number of entrants by their place of origin. It was not a matter of accepting candidates according to the distribution of the prefecture or setting the exam and reemploying the graduates according to their distribution in the population as a whole. Yet, from the point of view of selection of a political elite, this was clearly not focused solely on <em>talent</em>. The three persons recommended by each prefecture were not necessarily comparable. How could you know that a potential fourth or even eighth person recommended by Xuzhou was not equal to the first person suggested by Suzhou? Or the other way around? But this form of recruitment according to locale was always insisted on in later years. It cannot be read as merely the personal preference of a given emperor. Even if wrong, it was the path taken. But is this not what we mean by the truth of institutional evolution?<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_73">73</a></p><p>Necessities to repair this system did emerge. After some seven hundred years, there appeared the system of recruitment according to distribution in the north and south of China. In 1425, Emperor Ren Zong of the Ming dynasty decreed that the imperial examinations would take place according to equality of geographical provenance of candidates, that is, on the exam script itself the words “north,” “south,” and “center” were inscribed according to a proportion of 35 percent, 55 percent, and 10 percent.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_74">74</a> The percentages were later changed and adjusted, but the system itself remained in place until the exams were finally abolished in the late Qing dynasty. Not only was this system in place for the <em>jinshi</em> exam, it was also repeated throughout the Ming-Qing era in every province, in that the central government decreed how many candidates from each province could take part in the exams and in the <em>jinshi</em> exam.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_75">75</a></p><p>Therefore, we can conclude only that whether it was a matter of equality of geographical provenance or percentage of population permitted to take the exam and be granted the post of <em>jinshi</em>, the focus was not on selecting the elite per se, nor on satisfying the distribution of the elite according to the goal of an ideal society thought up by the ruling groups, but purely for a political reason. So even though there was a meritocracy, even though it was a matter of only scholars, it was political and did not become something “cultural.”</p><p>In the course of history, at least during the Northern Song dynasty, the imperial examinations did in fact take place without considering equality of geographical provenance. The result was that the economically and commercially developed capital city produced more <em>jinshi</em> than other areas, and proportionately more per capita than the whole country. This led to struggles among the scholars from north and south and their attempts to use this struggle to win influence and political clout in state politics and in the high levels of government. This brought the politician Sima Guang to suggest equality of geographical provenance for the exams.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_76">76</a> During the Yuan, even though the Han Chinese were a majority, the rulers wanted a balance among the candidates for exams and among the <em>jinshi</em> according to the four regions of Mongolia, Semu (Turkic and Tibetan areas, etc.), the Han Chinese of the north, and the Han of the south.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_77">77</a> The Mongols hoped that in this way they could guarantee that political governance and political equilibrium would be beneficial to them. Clearly, this was not fair, but unfair politics is not wholly devoid of common sense: selection of talent for a large state with both agrarian and pastoral communities and with many different ethnic groups could not solely be concerned with intelligence. It also needed to take account of political representation for regions and peoples.</p><p>This fact was soon to be proved by bloody means. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown, during the imperial examinations held in 1397 in the early Ming, candidates were treated equally, which led to a conflict between north and south. When the results were declared, it was found that all forty-two <em>jinshi</em> who passed were from the south. Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang sent experts to check for irregularities, but this showed that the best script from a northern candidate was still far behind some of those from the south who had also failed. Such an imbalance is not unthinkable. The problem lay not in intelligence but in the social background. After the Eastern Jin, the economic center of China began to move south. From the Southern Song to the Yuan, the south was always more stable than the north. Its economy and culture were more developed. The Ming dynasty itself started off in the south and gradually spread its influence northward. This implies that the south had acquired peace and stability earlier and for longer. But although this makes good sense and in an abstract sense is perfectly fair, the results of the exam led to dissatisfaction among the political elite of the north. Even worse, although the emperor’s family came from north of the Yangtze, they came under the jurisdiction of the south and so were reckoned as southerners. Even though he was emperor and it should not have touched him, he felt implicated. Therefore, he wrote a decree ordering the chief examiner to change the roster and enroll some northerners to counter the complaints. But in insisting on equality according to the marks gained, the rule of law, and a spirit of absolute rectitude, the chief examiner and the expert who undertook the review refused to countenance the emperor’s demand and paid no attention to the political and social consequences of their practice of the law. When law pays no attention to political and social consequences, politics and society may well completely spurn the law. The emperor intervened in the political conflict and crisis between northern and southern scholars and ordered the execution of the chief examiner and the review expert and also of the candidate who won first place, albeit quite innocent in this affair, and then ordered a retaking of the exam. He then examined the scripts himself and selected sixty-one <em>jinshi</em>, who all happened to come from the north<img src="/../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_78" alt="78"></p><p>This is, of course, a tragedy for the law, but also for politics. It shows us that the elite were partially blind to reality and even more that politics can be very political. A meritocracy does not change political affiliation. In fact, meritocracy is even more sensitive to political interests and more ready to use politics to attain its interests. Not only is the inborn imagination of a community limited, being an agrarian society further limited the imagination of the ancients. Therefore, suspicions based on origins are very easily aroused and very easily used by others, and as soon as these suspicions enter into the higher levels of politics, in a large state like China, the consequences will be enormous, even—as this case shows—disastrous. It is essential to prevent ambitious persons using these suspicions from splitting the state and reigniting the spark of war. Therefore, in the early Ming, the reason it was decided to use equality of geographic provenance in running the exams and choosing those who passed was, first, to pacify the cultural elite’s political ambitions and to maintain equilibrium of the political forces in each area. These are rules for examinations, but at the same time they touch on a constitutional issue of the selection of the members of the ruling political body.</p><p>This constitutional arrangement is something that politics throughout the dynasties had to face even during peacetime. If we look back into history, we can quite easily discover the rule: in the intense political and military conflict at the turn of a dynasty, there is historically a great crisis, a social revolution or a so-called restoration period, during which politics must overrule everything else. The top members of the political body virtually wholly ignore locality. Whether we look at the Pei County clique of Liu Bang, the Longxi group of Li Shimin, the Huaixi group of Zhu Yuanzhang, or the rule over China by minority peoples in the Yuan and Qing dynasties, at the foundation of the state, the key leaders paid no attention to geographical balance. But once an era of peace was inaugurated, the selection of the political elite, both among the high echelons and in the imperial examinations, could not fail to take into account provenance and ethnic origin.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_79">79</a> This just goes to show that the <em>key</em> consideration in the way the political elite are chosen lies not in their being the elite but in politics. In other words, even without any awareness of representative democracy, the political elite in ancient China always bore an element of local representation.</p><p>Based on the evolution of the selection system from selection to recommendation and to the examinations, it can be seen that, while the power of the central government had in fact increased, thus weakening the influence of the nobles and dominant families in the selection process, yet from the way of recommending, examining, and selecting officials, in the large state that is China, where there was a high degree of centralization and an emperor who held himself to be above all, the strength of the power of the central government or of the emperor or its legitimacy and the degree to which it had a comprehensive grasp of the politics, economy, and culture of the whole country still had to take into account (or at least could not overlook) the scholars of the regions that relied on their participation in politics and interests to foster acknowledgment of that authority. Consideration of geographical provenance in selecting a person to take part in state politics influenced the local structures by which the elite actually participated in state politics. In each province of China, in the north, south, and other politically important regions—such as frontier areas—the question of provenance became an important matter that the political leaders had to seriously consider in peacetime and that they had to deal with to achieve equilibrium within the system.</p><p>This explains why, in 1426, one year after the Ming had divided candidates into north and south, a third category—the center—was erected. Although this was changed subsequently, the tripartite division of north, south and center continued even in the Qing. It is of special interest to look more closely at this central division set up by the Ming. It included the four southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou but also the area around Zhu Yuanzhang’s own family home of Hefei, Fengyang, Chuzhou, and Hexian. In other words, it combined four southwestern provinces and parts of Anhui near the Yangtze and Huai rivers. These two areas were not only not contiguous; they were several thousand <em>li</em> apart and the culture and customs of the people living there were very different. But it is precisely this strangely delineated central region that most clearly reveals the political considerations and goals of the central government of the Ming. It was not only a panacea by which the central government kept control over the scholars of the whole country. Rather, it was a means by which the central government let all scholars understand that it had this concern at heart.</p><p>The first thing was to affirm political legitimacy, so that the Ming emperors could free themselves from the struggle among the scholars that had been brought to a crisis in the dispute between north and south. In that dispute, what had led the emperor to use extreme methods to intervene was not his ruthlessness but rather the fact that his family home of Fengyang was ascribed to the south. In this political struggle among the literati, no one dared to openly criticize Zhu himself, but the emperor understood that if he failed to manage this battle correctly then it would certainly lead the northern scholars and other members of the political elite to question whether the politics of the dynasty was fair, to wonder whether the Ming could escape the ethnic and regional biases of the Yuan. The unbreakable flow of history and the important underlying consequences of cultural and political separatism made it such that Zhu had no choice but to use extreme measures and execute the chief examiner, the winning candidate, and the inspector to show that he himself showed no partiality to southern scholars and thereby gain the confidence and support of the northern political elite.</p><p>This act could assuage the suspicions of the northern political elite only for a time; it was more difficult to dissipate the clouds of suspicion entirely. The southern political elite may have thought that to win over the northerners he would not sacrifice them, while the northerners might have thought it was all just a show on the part of the emperor. This is hardly an explanation, since it would still be difficult to understand why Fengyang should be attributed to the north. Zhu’s action in apportioning this small area, called Western Han, to the central region, which included the four southwestern provinces, and from which 10 percent of the <em>jinshi</em> were chosen, although it would not lead the northern and southern political elite to become suspicious, would help in the formation and reinforcement of the political and cultural community in the whole country. It was an option that could not be doubted.</p><p>But to appreciate the greater political interests Zhu Yuanzhang had in mind, we must wait until the end of the Qing dynasty. The establishment of the central area was to make clear to the scholars and latent political elite of the then politically and culturally underdeveloped regions of Yunnan and Guizhou, in particular, that the central government was determined to preserve a certain degree of participation for the southwest with its many ethnic groups and lower level of education, that it was determined to train scholars from that region to be able to participate in the government of the whole country. The bar for entry into politics for scholars from the four southwestern provinces was lowered. Possessing this real and predictable advantage, the scholars of the four provinces would strive even harder. This was a great advantage to the whole state in bringing about the political and cultural integration of the entire southwest. In particular, we should bear in mind that under the Yuan, this area had been classified as being barbarian, but from the Ming onward and throughout the Qing, it was brought under regular jurisdiction. This implies that the region had to furnish local people to work as the political and cultural elite, not only to participate in political governance of the whole country but also so that the local echelons of governance (or even the social elite) could take part in local political governance.</p><p>For this reason, we can confirm that the erection of the central district was carried out entirely for political reasons and not for elitist ones. Thanks to the special quota of <em>jinshi</em>, the central government in both dynasties was able to provide greater possibilities for the political elite of what was then more remote and underdeveloped regions to take part in politics. By affording various advantages in the central government to these districts, various channels of political representation and expression were set up. It created an important constitutional channel for the comprehensive integration of places and peoples within the whole county and for their cultural integration.</p><p>Is this not comparable to what, 550 years later, the constitutional political practice of the United States began to try, something that first emerged in higher education and then later in the fields of employment and professional promotion as affirmative action (for minorities)?<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_80">80</a> In ancient China, the imperial examinations were for high-level public officials and for their promotion. They were a necessary qualifying test for entering the higher echelons of politics, participating in high-level political policy making and planning. This measure was, for this reason, an effective means of opening up expression of local interests and transmission of information. This measure could not implement equal representation for local areas and ethnic groups in politics, but at least it could impress more effective channels of communication and some sense of representation of interests, such that in a large state covering a vast territory that was culturally backward and, for that reason, where local participation in politics at the state level was seriously inadequate, there were some basic channels and opportunities for the expression of local demands. By means of this quota system, officials from the remote southwest were able to enter the higher echelons of politics and, even if all they spoke about and all the issues they raised were matters of local interest, given that they had already accepted the political and cultural norms of China, they were not only representatives of the interests of their ethnic group or region but also members of the community of the political and cultural elite of the whole country. They came from the southwest but belonged to the political and cultural elite of the whole country and at least some of them spoke on political issues bearing in mind the long-term and fundamental interests of the whole state. For this reason, we may say that even though ancient China did not have a statewide system of representation, the selection of the political and cultural elite itself always comprised elements of local elite representation that led toward the goal of political and cultural unity and stability in the state, giving rise to functions that allowed for the voicing of local interests and functions making for equilibrium among different areas within China’s territory and among the interests of different ethnic groups and peoples.</p><p>Not only this. The imperial examinations also brought about social mobility. Ping-ti Ho studied 12,226 <em>jinshi</em> over a period of more than five centuries to look at social mobility in China. By analyzing their family backgrounds, he discovered that under the Qing, more than 30 percent of <em>jinshi</em> and more than 20 percent of <em>juren</em> and <em>gongsheng</em> came from among the commoners, defined as households that in the previous three generations had not given rise to any notable people. Moreover, his case studies also showed that there was downward social mobility, and one factor explaining this was rejection in the imperial examinations, which shows that the examinations were not monopolized by households that could not produce suitable candidates.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_81">81</a> But this very social mobility was another form of political formation and integration for ancient China. Since, even though each scholar already belonged to the class of the scholar-officials, he could not escape his family background or his original social class, because he could not cut his ties of interest or feeling for them; therefore, when sociologists look at social mobility, from a political point of view, it is this representation of social class that matters.</p><p>These two elements of representation may seem to be trivial, but that is not certainly so.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_82">82</a> Second, even if they are trivial this does not naturally create an effective basis for criticism, unless one thinks numbers are worth pursuing in themselves. A correct standard of criticism would be to ask whether, in a large agrarian state with many peoples, ethnic groups, and cultures and where transportation and communication are difficult, such a representative element is better than none, whether it is helpful in expanding peace and stability to the people who so much needed them. Furthermore, it should not be supposed that the greater the representation the better, because in agrarian China there were inevitably marked variations in the economic advantages enjoyed by each region, such that overrepresentation would be like throwing in a plate of shifting sand or a heap of potatoes and might lead to division or separatism rather than to affirming cultural identity or patriotism.</p><p>Given such social conditions, in a large agrarian state, what is required is meritocracy. Hence, whatever the case, intelligence alone cannot be the only criterion, elements of representation of localities and of class must be infused and included, to eliminate, as far as possible, any possible lack of confidence and maintain a balance in political power. In this sense, ancient China’s choice of meritocracy was not because it superstitiously believed in elitism. Rather, it should be assessed and judged comprehensively in terms of many political factors at that given time and place and to satisfy a pragmatic, consequentialist approach to the relationship between these factors and the elite.</p><p>This analysis reveals the difficulty in ancient China’s meritocracy. Behind attracting the elite to participate in politics, we can see that there must be deep and profound political considerations. Besides ensuring there are persons who are willing and able to participate in the process and running of the political governance of the state, and winning their unreserved political loyalty, it is also important to strive to reduce any possible suspicions arising in any place, class, ethnic group, or political faction. One must create a balance of forces among them and, thanks to the sense of security provided thereby, bring it about that they consciously rely on this institution to express and reconcile their demands, so that their individual talents mesh together and, when necessary, balance or cancel each other out.</p><p>Therefore, in evaluating naturally good persons or idealists, it is still necessary to point out that, in practice, among the political elite there will certainly be some who are not so outstanding. In China we call them “Thick Blacks,” in the West “Machiavellian,” but precisely for this reason they are truly political and constitutional factors. This is to take people who may have a certain share of ability and&#x2F;or reputation, but who on the political level are not necessarily loyal, or not sufficiently so, or who are even downright opportunists, the preelite or even pseudo-elite, and “keep” them with the purpose of reaping the rewards of their intelligence and ability and doing so only to prevent them from being used by any major opposition force or faction, even if that is what they actually seek to do. In this sense, this “use” of them may well include, as a last resort, supporting them unemployed in order to preserve the effective unity and political governance of the whole state. Logically this is at least a feasible, even a necessary, part of the structure of an authentic meritocracy both in ancient China and even in any state at any time.</p><p>The uniform imperial examination did not just affirm the institution of one culture and education, nor was it a habitual way of selecting civil servants. Rather, it was an institutional framework that promoted participation in political representation and its realization. In every part of China and at every level, it encouraged and facilitated comparatively peaceful social, economic, cultural, and political development and strengthened political and cultural representation for every place in China, and thus reinforced the political and cultural constitution of ancient China. Even though people today see only the direct consequences of that institution—the selection of talent—what the institution was really concerned with and what it actually did was not merely to absorb the talent of the state, but to absorb it in a statewide, comprehensive, and balanced way, which had implications for representation and political participation of local places. This is a profound and far-thinking piece of constitutional intuition!</p><p><em>A Final Assessment</em></p><p>This chapter’s argument is not just to explain why, in ancient agrarian China, the planning for the institution of meritocracy and the operation of that institution had to be at the constitutional level, had to be based on constitutional considerations, and had to have complex constitutional arrangements, but to go further to say that all the institutional considerations, concerns, and technical details relating to meritocracy cannot be perceived clearly, or even understood, if one uses only the framework and theory of some foreign constitutional order. It is enough to go into the society and linguistic history of ancient agrarian China not only to understand that it is possible to judge what is good or bad but even to understand the advantages and disadvantages of what was done. Most important, however you assess the matter, your outlook may suddenly broaden, and you will see that the ancients used their own strength and action to create the world of that constitutional practice and theory.</p><p>We must also note that for ancient China, meritocracy at another level had to be constitutional. This means that almost all of China’s other basic institutions, such as the political framework by which the center and periphery were related, fiscal and taxation issues in the state’s economic life, the peaceful livelihood of the ordinary people everywhere, the army that provided international and domestic security, and even the unified script and Mandarin Chinese in education, including the imperial examinations themselves, were all bound to these members of the political elite. There was not an independent institution bound to a concrete person that operated outside the system. All institutions were formed by concrete individuals who had accepted the institutional norms and customs and who naturally ran things according to the set norms, such that should anyone break the norms they would be checked by persons who held firmly to them. Without these people, the elite, there would be no institution; there would, at the most, be only a few texts.</p><p>This is why in a large state like China, the rule must be “the law alone does not suffice” and “there are governing people but no governing laws,” and why the political line is drawn first while “the cadres are the deciding elements.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_83">83</a> All this sounds rather like rule by man but in fact does not fit that description. Indeed, the opposite is true: it is rule by law and rule by law for a large state with all the concomitant issues. Since all posts are assumed by the elite and business is run by them, from Michel Foucault’s perspective we can see that from what they say and do every day, there is a forceful constitutional life and institutional current at work.</p><p>But to say what institutions are constitutional is to simply point out that the issues they involve are very important for the state and in the long term, and it never means that they are closer to God or truth or ultimate truth or universal values. In no sense does it mean, either, that these concrete institutions lack faults or that their effects may not be disastrous. That is why they need to progress over time and not simply imitate the past without reform for the present. Under the selection system it was said that one could recommend an “outstanding” person who knew no books and “elevate” a worthy person who made his father move out of the house. The recommendation system ultimately led to the upper ranks never having an unvisited house while the lower ranks had no influential family members. The imperial examinations became ossified with the eight-legged essay and incidents such as the one mocked in the story “Fan Jin Passes the Exam.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_84">84</a> But this was never the standard of assessment for the institution. The question was not whether the institution as such was wholly good or wholly bad but whether, overall, <em>in the social and historical conditions of the time</em>, it would have been better not to have had this institution or whether it was possible to imagine or create and run for a long time an institution that would achieve better results.</p><p>But also because of this, since time bears all away, it may be that what was once constitutional may no longer be of constitutional significance. With the needs set by modern China’s economy, politics, and society and changes in knowledge, the imperial examinations were abolished in 1905 and replaced by modern schools. But an even more persuasive piece of evidence is to be found in the Taiwan region, which, following the Five-Powers Constitution of the Republic of China, has set up the <em>Yuan</em> examination that attempts to continue the system of ancient China, though in fact it has devolved into a Ministry of Human Resources.<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_85">85</a> “The autumn wind still sighs, but the world has changed.”<a href="../Text/23_Notes.xhtml#rfn3_86">86</a> Even though the authors of the Constitution <em>wrote it into the text of the Constitution and continued to use</em> what was once an important institution <em>by setting up a body for that purpose</em>, without the agrarian background of China in the past or the constitutional issues of that time, it lost its significance as something that could bind the whole country together and thus was no longer of constitutional significance. It is merely a piece of decoration.</p><p>It is precisely the change of the social background that has led many Chinese scholars today, either consciously or unconsciously, to equate the imperial examinations with the current civil service examinations, but they rarely understand this in terms of the constitutional significance that has, throughout history, shaped the politics and culture of China. But you can still feel the solemn weight of years!</p>]]></content>
