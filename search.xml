        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="What-are-video-games"><a href="#What-are-video-games" class="headerlink" title="What are video games?"></a>What are video games?</h1><p>Video games are a very broad concept. Because it is well known that video games are a type of games. Then video games should bring many different ways of relaxation just like games. “But is that the case?” Many people ask such questions. Obviously I’m not one of them. Because I personally don’t think video games are electronic heroin. The reason for this is as follows.</p><h2 id="First-point"><a href="#First-point" class="headerlink" title="First point"></a>First point</h2><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/1p/wallhaven-1pj25v.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://wallhaven.cc/w/1pj25v">https://wallhaven.cc/w/1pj25v</a></p><p>What do you see? Huge whale? prosperous city? The world of science fiction? Obviously we all know this is not the real world that exists. But that’s why it’s attractive, and the degree to which it appeals to different people is different. For example, working adults and teenagers. Adults often don’t have more energy to fantasize due to work and family reasons, so they are less attractive to the world of science fiction. But teenagers look forward to such a world more, and they will imagine that if they live in such a world, this is one of the main reasons why they can be attracted. Let’s talk about video games again. The picture of video games is the same as the picture above. My personal opinion is that it’s quite normal to be attracted by this kind of sci-fi world. If even such a world can’t bring considerable attraction to human beings, then there should be a lot of problems with human emotions.</p><h2 id="Second-point"><a href="#Second-point" class="headerlink" title="Second point"></a>Second point</h2><h3 id="Analyze-the-issue-from-the-perspective-of-beauty"><a href="#Analyze-the-issue-from-the-perspective-of-beauty" class="headerlink" title="Analyze the issue from the perspective of beauty."></a>Analyze the issue from the perspective of beauty.</h3><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png" alt="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png"></p><p>Cite:<a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png</a></p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg" alt="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg</a>: </p><p>The two pictures above are quite stunning. One is from reality and the other is from fantasy. I believe both images will appeal to us.</p><h4 id="Let-me-tell-a-story"><a href="#Let-me-tell-a-story" class="headerlink" title="Let me tell a story."></a>Let me tell a story.</h4><p>You are a knight from the west, you train hard every day, you made your body is very strong, and you have a very good blacksmith friend, he made you an armor that is very suitable for you. You are very happy. But not long after, the war came, a bloody battle, oneself person with a sword, killed seven times in and seven times out in the royal city. The enemy is thrown off his feet by the one you kill. But in the end, due to lack of strength and preparation, you were defeated in the end. You also fell in a pool of blood. When you open your eyes again, what you see is the roof of a small wooden house, and a beautiful girl is wiping your cheek, and she is overjoyed to see you open your eyes. But you can’t hear her voice at all at this time, you can only see her mouth moving. You try to open your mouth but feel severe pain. In desperation, you try to show her with your hand that you can’t hear her, but when you try to make this gesture. You find that you can’t feel your arms and hands anymore. You start to panic, you feel a huge sense of oppression, you don’t know what’s going on, the hand that was so obedient before has no feeling at all at this moment. You blink desperately and call for her help. She seems to understand what you mean, her hands hover over your face, and you see her cherry lips slightly open and close. You notice a faint green glow in the palm of her hand resting on your face. You don’t understand, and you dare not move. After a few minutes, your ears began to hear the slightest sound, and some words that you could not understand came from the mouth of the girl in front of you. You tried to open your mouth to ask, but she looked at you and shook her head slightly, signaling you to wait a little longer. After a few more minutes, the girl stopped whispering and said to you, you can talk now. You try to open your mouth again, this time without the slightest pain. You ask where this is. The girl didn’t answer your question, but said, “Your arm is still hurt. I have applied herbs and used healing magic on you. It should heal in a few days.” After the girl’s conversation You know that this is a place with Ling (Spirit power) and magic. According to the girl, this is a country that exists in the east of the world…</p><p>Now it’s a story I wrote casually. I’m still thinking about the follow-up of the story, but this is the text I thought about through the two pictures above. If I use it for a video game, I don’t know if anyone will like it, but this is it I want to explain. The appeal of video games is through fantasy, and human fantasy is very great. So it is very normal for people to be attracted to video games.</p>]]></content>

Most games these days involve violence, gambling, sex and other forms of addictive behavior. Players feel compelled to keep playing after finishing a game because they still crave more entertainment or content. Many online games have monthly or annual fees that players must pay to continue playing.

As shown in the picture above, very cute? I hope I’m using the right words. It also shows that there are many kinds of video games. But often people like extreme cases, because then they can find the point of attack. But it is always ordinary players and some parents who are injured. Back to the original god. The character of the original god can control one of the seven natural elements ice, grass, fire, water, wind, thunder, and rock. These elements can interact in different ways, and switching characters during combat and performing these abilities allows these elements to interact. Solving puzzles in the overworld may require certain elemental abilities. The game uses an open world map. In addition to normal walking, players can explore various ruins and terrains by climbing, swimming, gliding and other mobile means.</p><p>Compared with games with violent elements such as GTA V, Genshine Impact is very peaceful.</p><p>This is a simple example to refute the case that video games simply bring violence.</p>]]></content>

Mobile games or video games</h4><p>​There are currently more than 2.5 billion video game players worldwide, and the market is expected to exceed $90 billion by 2020. In order to stand out in this huge market, companies must understand what types of games women are most passionate about and why. A study by data analytics firm Newzoo found that women are generally more likely than men to play games for stress relief or entertainment purposes. The mobile gaming market now accounts for more than 50% of the global gaming market and is expected to grow by double digits. Of those, 64 percent of women prefer to play games on mobile devices, compared to 38 percent of men. Meanwhile, 43 percent of female mobile gamers reported playing games five or more days a week. These numbers are indirect evidence of the purchasing power of female gamers.</p><p><img src="https://www.eastwestbank.com/content/dam/ewb-dotcom/reachfurther/newsarticlestore/586/Women-in-video-gaming-top4.jpg"></p><p>Cite（<a href="https://www.eastwestbank.com/content/dam/ewb-dotcom/reachfurther/newsarticlestore/586/Women-in-video-gaming-top4.jpg%EF%BC%89">https://www.eastwestbank.com/content/dam/ewb-dotcom/reachfurther/newsarticlestore/586/Women-in-video-gaming-top4.jpg）</a></p><h4 id="Why-don’t-female-get-good-looks-in-video-games"><a href="#Why-don’t-female-get-good-looks-in-video-games" class="headerlink" title="Why don’t female get good looks in video games"></a>Why don’t female get good looks in video games</h4><p>​In the world, the number of female gamers is gradually increasing, but there is no denying that the number of female gamers will not surpass that of male gamers in the short term. The reason is that there are too few games for girls. </p><p>​Girls love to play games, but love is not so deep. We want to see more girls enjoy games. A lot of girls like video games not because they like video games, but because they like video games for other reasons, like because a friend likes video games, so when they try to play video games.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="What-are-video-games"><a href="#What-are-video-games" class="headerlink" title="What are video games"></a>What are video games</h1><p>This is a very large problem. Not just because it’s a video game question, but because it encompasses countless family relationship questions. Video games are not monsters, much less electronic drugs. Video games began in the United States in the late 1960s. They first started to develop on arcade machines or video game consoles (home consoles, handheld consoles), and then games on personal computers and mobile device platforms appeared. Electronic games mainly consist of games inherited from traditional gaming activities: electronic games such as football, baseball, chess, word and number games. It also has functions that traditional games do not have, such as adventures, wars, and events from human fantasy worlds. Although video games have been criticized for their potentially harmful effects, researchers have found ways to use them to help people live better.</p><p>​Video games are very attractive. This feature can not only make people addicted, but also can become a “vivid textbook” with proper conversion. Through the magic of video games, children can eat more vegetables, help the elderly keep their brains active, and even use video games to solve social problems such as poverty and climate change.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/o5/wallhaven-o5d1zm.jpg"></p><p>Cite：<a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/o5/wallhaven-o5d1zm.jpg">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/o5/wallhaven-o5d1zm.jpg</a></p><p>As shown in the picture above, there may be such a huge sci-fi space station in the future world. But at least until today, it is completely impossible, and this is only possible in people’s fantasy.</p><p>Laurie called the children born after the end of the twentieth century digital immigrants, and they have lived in an era full of technological development since their birth. And that means the difference between centuries.</p><hr><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/gp/wallhaven-gpjexe.jpg"></p><p>Cite：<a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/gp/wallhaven-gpjexe.jpg">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/gp/wallhaven-gpjexe.jpg</a></p><h4 id="Raise-A-Question"><a href="#Raise-A-Question" class="headerlink" title="Raise A Question"></a>Raise A Question</h4><p>Video games really popular among digital natives, represent one aspect of this debate. Educators and parents question whether games hinder academic education or can be used as a tool to enhance education. They also disagree about the impact of video games on children’s moral and social education.</p><p>[<a href="https://go-gale-com.ezp.slu.edu/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&amp;u=sain44199&amp;id=GALE%7CEJ3010669101&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;asid=46c19cba.%5D">https://go-gale-com.ezp.slu.edu/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&amp;u=sain44199&amp;id=GALE%7CEJ3010669101&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;asid=46c19cba.]</a>: </p><h4 id="Reply"><a href="#Reply" class="headerlink" title="Reply"></a>Reply</h4><p>​First, I personally think games can be fun; playing games is a great way to relax and relieve stress. You can play casually, or join competitions with other players in the area, which can be fun and rewarding. So games are one of the ways to relax.</p><p>​Games can help people connect with others in a meaningful way. One of the advantages of playing games is that it creates a sense of community among players across the globe who interact with each other and become friends through online games. This allows people to socialize and form new friendships without leaving the house, and can also help those with poor social skills.</p><hr><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/9d/wallhaven-9d5o8w.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://wallhaven.cc/w/9d5o8w">https://wallhaven.cc/w/9d5o8w</a></p><h4 id="Opposition"><a href="#Opposition" class="headerlink" title="Opposition"></a>Opposition</h4><p>Those concerned about the harm video games can cause might point to games in the <em><a href="https://go-gale-com.ezp.slu.edu/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&u=sain44199&id=GALE%7CEJ3010669101&v=2.1&it=r&asid=46c19cba.#">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series or the <em>Halo</em> series. Both of these games are in the “first-person shooter” genre, in which the player takes on a first-person role in a realistic or science fiction scenario, and the object of the game is to destroy opponents by shooting them.</p><p>[<a href="https://go-gale-com.ezp.slu.edu/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&amp;u=sain44199&amp;id=GALE%7CEJ3010669101&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;asid=46c19cba.%5D">https://go-gale-com.ezp.slu.edu/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&amp;u=sain44199&amp;id=GALE%7CEJ3010669101&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;asid=46c19cba.]</a>: </p><p>![20220815025539932](D:\Big Blog\source\image\20220815025539932.jpeg)</p><p>![Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Screenshot-2020.02.19-19.22.59.75-副本](D:\Big Blog\source\image\Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Screenshot-2020.02.19-19.22.59.75-副本.png)</p><h4 id="Debate"><a href="#Debate" class="headerlink" title="Debate"></a>Debate</h4><p>As those who suggest video games are one of the causes of violence believe, video games have become like real life. 3D scenes, real game environment, so that every player can feel immersive. But at the same time, I hope that those who claim that video games cause or induce people to crime and violence will understand more about the core of a video game. Every good video game is the product of a group of dozens, or even hundreds of people, that took years to complete. Each of their works is created around a theme. It’s like a play, there are good guys on the team, and there are bad guys on the team. The creation concept of this play cannot be denied just because of the appearance of villains. And the most important thing is that whether a person is good or bad is not determined by a video game. Their family, teachers, parents, and friends will guide them to understand what is right. That’s why I disagree with the objections, they’re just describing a scene from a video game in a one-sided way, like a paragraph in a novel. This is not enough to prove that video games cause violence and harm society.</p><p>Work Cites (MLA)</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>“History of video games”. advance-lexis-com.ezp.slu.edu&#x2F;api&#x2F;document?      collection&#x3D;news&amp;id&#x3D;urn:contentItem:666D-HBR1-JCG7-8567-00000-00&amp;context&#x3D;1516831. </p><p>“Can video games be addictive?

The earliest recorded video game was a Tic-Tac-Toe game played on a vacuum tube computer in 1952. Video games were introduced as a commercial entertainment medium in the 1970s and became the basis of a significant entertainment industry in Japan, the United States and Europe in the late 1970s.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/we/wallhaven-we87vx.jpg"></p><h4 id="Video-Gameplay-Effects"><a href="#Video-Gameplay-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Video Gameplay Effects"></a>Video Gameplay Effects</h4><p>​Video games mentioned by the author are one of the computer-based ways to play games, and video games can also be effective in relieving physical and mental addictions. The problem here I think is the difference between the definition of video game addiction and the definition of other types of addiction. At the same time, the author puts forward a very effective point Author Ford talked about the physical exercise that video games can bring, such as physical activity. There are also video games that improve the hands-on skills of children and people. This boosts your child’s self-confidence in many ways. And video games mean the cutting-edge level of technology. As one of the most powerful products in the software era, video games must be very influential. And in the game, people can get a lot of activities that cannot be done in real life. Such as jungle adventures, horror survival games, zombies, shooting games, many people like guns, but in reality guns are more dangerous, so they can understand the structure of guns, the range of bullets, and the difference between different guns in the game. the difference. And from a psychological level, video games have certain competitiveness, which can also exercise people’s fear of competition, so that people who play video games can better understand social interaction and how to communicate with people. And in some cases, players can get jobs through games and earn money through games.Even if video games can help people’s brains stay active, it can prevent the occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>​Video games emerged as a form of relaxation and entertainment. Subsequently, with the development of computer technology, it gradually evolved into an effective tool. In addition to being a form of leisure entertainment, video games can also be used as a means of education and medical treatment.</p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/3l/wallhaven-3l9z69.png"></p><hr><p>Work Cites</p><p>“Why Should You Play Video Games?”. advance-lexis-com.ezp.slu.edu&#x2F;api&#x2F;document?collection&#x3D;news&amp;id&#x3D;urn:contentItem:664J-N511-F03R-N0Y5-00000-00&amp;context&#x3D;1516831.</p>]]></content>
