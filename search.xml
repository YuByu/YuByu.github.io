        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="What-is-video-games"><a href="#What-is-video-games" class="headerlink" title="What is video games?"></a>What is video games?</h1><p>Video games are a very broad concept. Because it is well known that video games are a type of games. Then video games should bring many different ways of relaxation just like games. “But is that the case?” Many people ask such questions. Obviously I’m not one of them. Because I personally don’t think video games are electronic heroin. The reason for this is as follows.</p><h2 id="First-point"><a href="#First-point" class="headerlink" title="First point"></a>First point</h2><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/1p/wallhaven-1pj25v.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://wallhaven.cc/w/1pj25v">https://wallhaven.cc/w/1pj25v</a></p><p>What do you see? Huge whale? prosperous city? The world of science fiction? Obviously we all know this is not the real world that exists. But that’s why it’s attractive, and the degree to which it appeals to different people is different. For example, working adults and teenagers. Adults often don’t have more energy to fantasize due to work and family reasons, so they are less attractive to the world of science fiction. But teenagers look forward to such a world more, and they will imagine that if they live in such a world, this is one of the main reasons why they can be attracted. Let’s talk about video games again. The picture of video games is the same as the picture above. My personal opinion is that it’s quite normal to be attracted by this kind of sci-fi world. If even such a world can’t bring considerable attraction to human beings, then there should be a lot of problems with human emotions.</p><h2 id="Second-point"><a href="#Second-point" class="headerlink" title="Second point"></a>Second point</h2><h3 id="Analyze-the-issue-from-the-perspective-of-beauty"><a href="#Analyze-the-issue-from-the-perspective-of-beauty" class="headerlink" title="Analyze the issue from the perspective of beauty."></a>Analyze the issue from the perspective of beauty.</h3><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png" alt="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png"></p><p>Cite:<a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/ex/wallhaven-exol5w.png</a></p><p><img src="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg" alt="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg"></p><p>Cite: <a href="https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg">https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kx/wallhaven-kx9dv6.jpg</a>: </p><p>The two pictures above are quite stunning. One is from reality and the other is from fantasy. I believe both images will appeal to us.</p><h4 id="Let-me-tell-a-story"><a href="#Let-me-tell-a-story" class="headerlink" title="Let me tell a story."></a>Let me tell a story.</h4><p>You are a knight from the west, you train hard every day, you made your body is very strong, and you have a very good blacksmith friend, he made you an armor that is very suitable for you. You are very happy. But not long after, the war came, a bloody battle, oneself person with a sword, killed seven times in and seven times out in the royal city. The enemy is thrown off his feet by the one you kill. But in the end, due to lack of strength and preparation, you were defeated in the end. You also fell in a pool of blood. When you open your eyes again, what you see is the roof of a small wooden house, and a beautiful girl is wiping your cheek, and she is overjoyed to see you open your eyes. But you can’t hear her voice at all at this time, you can only see her mouth moving. You try to open your mouth but feel severe pain. In desperation, you try to show her with your hand that you can’t hear her, but when you try to make this gesture. You find that you can’t feel your arms and hands anymore. You start to panic, you feel a huge sense of oppression, you don’t know what’s going on, the hand that was so obedient before has no feeling at all at this moment. You blink desperately and call for her help. She seems to understand what you mean, her hands hover over your face, and you see her cherry lips slightly open and close. You notice a faint green glow in the palm of her hand resting on your face. You don’t understand, and you dare not move. After a few minutes, your ears began to hear the slightest sound, and some words that you could not understand came from the mouth of the girl in front of you. You tried to open your mouth to ask, but she looked at you and shook her head slightly, signaling you to wait a little longer. After a few more minutes, the girl stopped whispering and said to you, you can talk now. You try to open your mouth again, this time without the slightest pain. You ask where this is. The girl didn’t answer your question, but said, “Your arm is still hurt. I have applied herbs and used healing magic on you. It should heal in a few days.” After the girl’s conversation You know that this is a place with Ling (Spirit power) and magic. According to the girl, this is a country that exists in the east of the world…</p><p>Now it’s a story I wrote casually. I’m still thinking about the follow-up of the story, but this is the text I thought about through the two pictures above. If I use it for a video game, I don’t know if anyone will like it, but this is it I want to explain. The appeal of video games is through fantasy, and human fantasy is very great. So it is very normal for people to be attracted to video games.</p>]]></content>
